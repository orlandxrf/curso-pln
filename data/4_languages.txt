english approval of the minutes of the previous sitting
english the minutes of yesterday s sitting have been distributed
english are there any comments
english mr president on monday i made a point of order about president nicole fontaine s reported comments in the british press regarding her recent visit with her majesty queen elizabeth ii
english a british labour member of this house mr miller repeated what were purported to be the queen s remarks not once but three times on monday on tuesday and on wednesday
english he sought to drag the queen into a political controversy and to use her name to score cheap political points
english mr president it may be that president fontaine was unfamiliar with the british rules of protocol which obtain in such matters but mr miller has no such excuse
english he knows perfectly well that ours is a non political head of state
english he knows perfectly well that for nearly fifty years she has scrupulously avoided engaging in controversial political issues
english he knows perfectly well that she cannot come to this house to set the record straight
english his behaviour is a disgrace and a scandal
english mr president i am proud to be british but today i am ashamed to share my nationality with that man
english has he no shame
english has he no respect healthday
english has he no decency or honour at all
english mr president i wish to use this point of order to speak in my capacity as chairman of the delegation for relations with the countries of central america and mexico
english as you will be aware elections were held in mexico last sunday
english yesterday the delegation which i chair met and discussed a report drawn up by our fellow members who had been to mexico to act as observers at these elections on behalf of this parliament
english mr president i would ask you to see if the president of this parliament could forward our resolution the complete text of which you will receive today to the mexican authorities
english mr president ladies and gentlemen i want to draw your attention to something really annoying in connection with the minutes
english the x texts adopted x also form part of the minutes
english i pointed out yesterday during the vote on the directive to combat money laundering the english translation of article needs to be corrected to bring it in line with amendment no because the english translation is wrong
english in the middle of the second paragraph of the english version there is only a reference to representation in legal proceedings but no reference to legal consultants as there is in the german text
english that is a key point in this directive and since the council working group is working on the basis of the english text it is quite crucial to correct this text
english i had already complained about this in committee vis vis the language services
english at the time the committee decided not to table an amendment because the german text is the original version as drafted by the rapporteur
english i complained about this yesterday the situation was not remedied and today is the third time i am complaining about it
english i do think the services of this house should work more carefully on such key questions and it really is intolerable that despite my criticism yesterday the minutes have got the text wrong again
english i would ask you get to the bottom of this matter to sort out this most important aspect of the directive and to please correct this in the english translation
english mr president yesterday we received a communication on yellow paper from the vice president with some nuts attached to it
english this note was about supporting the export of products from vanuatu a developing country in the pacific
english i think that is a very good idea and quite right
english and i am quite happy to support it
english but what rather puzzles me is that in it the vice president quite explicitly stated that it is illegal to import these nuts into the european union
english so i must ask this vice president to explain how these nuts came to be illegally imported since it was he who delivered them to us
english that in itself is a contradiction so would he please clarify the matter
english laughter and applause
english the minutes were approved
english welcome
english committee on petitions european ombudsman
english the next item is the joint debate on the following reports tabled on behalf of the committee on petitions
english a by mrs lambert on the deliberations of the committee on petitions during the parliamentary year
english a by mrs thors on the annual report on the activities of the european ombudsman in
english mr president i am glad to have the opportunity to address the european parliament concerning the results of my work as european ombudsman in the year
english the annual report for covers the last year of the first mandate of the european ombudsman
english last year the ombudsman s office received new complaints compared to in an increase of nearly
english the number of inquiries opened rose from in to in an increase of over
english as well as becoming better known the european ombudsman is also attracting a higher proportion of serious complaints which require full investigation
english you may be interested to know that the same trend has continued to the present year
english during the first six months of this year the number of new inquiries rose by over the same period in
english inquiries are the most resource intensive aspect of the ombudsman s work
english it is therefore a great challenge to deal with this increase whilst maintaining the quality of our work and meeting our target of closing most inquiries within one year
english i do hope that the european parliament will support the ombudsman in seeking the resources needed to carry out the work effectively
english during we continued to receive a quite high proportion of complaints over which lay outside the mandate of the european ombudsman
english the proportion of the complaints outside the mandate even increased slightly probably because we received a growing number of complaints by e mail
english we gladly accept complaints by e mail and many of them contain well presented allegations of maladministration
english however in all more of the e mail complaints are directed against authorities of member states
english during the campaign for the election of a european ombudsman last year some critical voices suggested that the ombudsman s mandate should be broadened to include complaints against member states in cases where a question of european union law is involved
english i am not sure whether they understood that this would mean the european ombudsman carrying out tasks currently belonging to the european commission as the guardian of the treaty and to the european parliament as the democratic forum to which citizens may address petitions
english we study carefully all the complaints we receive especially if they involve rights under european union law
english in we managed to advise the complainant or transfer the complaint to a competent body in about half of the cases
english of these we transferred cases to the european parliament to be dealt with as petitions and advised a further complainants of their rights to petition the european parliament
english in many cases complaints against national regional or local authorities could be dealt with effectively by an ombudsman in the member states concerned
english in every member state there should be a non judicial body which can assist european citizens in conflicts with member states administration concerning their rights under european union law
english as a believer in subsidiarity i remain convinced that the most effective way to achieve this result is through the development of a network of cooperation with these ombudsmen as similar bodies such as petitions committees
english we organised jointly with the french ombudsman mr stasi a seminar for national ombudsmen and similar bodies
english in paris in september mr perry the first vice chairman of the committee on petitions represented the european parliament
english a further seminar is planned to take place in brussels under the belgian presidency of the council in the year in cooperation with the commission and with belgium federal and regional ombudsmen
english the regional ombudsmen and similar bodies were invited to a meeting in florence last year in which mr gemelli the chairman of the committee on petitions also attended
english the regional ombudsmen and similar bodies will also be invited to brussels next year
english the ombudsmen and similar bodies in the member states have shown a positive attitude towards cooperation with the european ombudsman
english i strongly believe that cooperation with them on equal terms will achieve the best results for european citizens
english at the beginning great doubts were expressed as to whether the european ombudsman had sufficient powers to achieve anything for the citizen
english these doubts were unjustified because the community s institutions and bodies have responded properly to the ombudsman s work
english since the beginning they have themselves settled the complaint to the satisfaction of the complainant in over cases
english for example they have replied to unanswered letters made payments that are due and reversed previous unfavourable decisions
english this indicates a spirit of responsiveness and flexibility superior to those national administrations of which i have experience
english sixty two of these settlements occurred last year reducing the scope for friendly solutions to be proposed by the ombudsman
english however we did achieve one friendly solution in in a case where the commission and the council agreed that the complainant should be paid the amount due him for his work as a european union regional coordinator monitoring the palestinian elections
english if the institution or body concerned will not correct the maladministration itself the ombudsman s ultimate weapon is to draft a recommendation followed if necessary by a special report to european parliament
english five years ago there were many people who said that the community institutions and bodies did not pay much heed to european parliament
english even if they might have been right then things have clearly changed since the treaty of amsterdam and the fall of the santer commission
english in we made ten draft recommendations
english in seven cases the institution concerned has accepted a draft recommendation
english in two cases the ombudsman has made a special report to the european parliament
english one case remains ongoing since europol needs more time to comply with the draft recommendation that it should approve some public access to documents
english i believe that the european ombudsman s activities have reached the level that one has the right to expect of a body which is new and consists of persons working in a fairly complex legal environment
english we are achieving results for european citizens and this is what matters above all
english i would like to use this opportunity to thank all the community institutions and bodies for another year of constructive cooperation
english i would especially like to address the commission and its responsible member mrs loyola de palacio and thank her for continuing her predecessor s commitment to an honest and constructive attitude towards cooperation with the ombudsman
english i would also like to express my warm appreciation for the helpful and cooperative attitude towards the ombudsman s office shown by the committee on petitions and especially its vice chairman mr gemelli and also thank the rapporteur for the committee on petitions mrs thors for her important work on her comprehensive report
english thank you for your attention
english mr president the report that i am presenting this morning is effectively a dual report which reflects the work of the committee itself and the work of the office of parliament s mediator for transnationally abducted children mrs banotti
english i should also like to express my personal appreciation of the work of mr s derman the ombudsman
english i should also like to thank the secretariat of the committee not least for the statistical break down which is provided there which i must confess is not my own work
english i would urge members who are not familiar with the committee on petitions to read these reports
english it might well be of use to them in providing a service for the people they represent
english i would also draw their attention to the website mentioned set up under the europe direct initiative which could provide useful information and possibly avoid the need for a petition or indeed confirm it as an appropriate vehicle
english there is a growing need for such information as people become more aware of the importance and relevance of the european union level
english the aim of the committee on petitions itself is to provide a good and effective service for individuals within the european union and for civil society generally
english any individual citizen resident or group may petition parliament if they feel that community law or principles are not being properly applied at whatever level
english last year we received petitions of which were considered admissible
english i will mention just two of them to demonstrate the range of the topics and the potential effectiveness of the mechanism
english we had one british petitioner who succeeded in getting her years of teaching experience recognised by the french authorities presumably affecting her salary and promotion prospects
english in another case a petition from a spanish citizen acting for an environmental association resulted in infringement proceedings being brought against the spanish authorities in relation to the habitats directive a frequent cause of complaint the directive not the authorities with lasting national effect
english it is such cases which provide valuable feedback to the european parliament and the other institutions as to how our legislation works to the benefit of the individuals and society or not as the case may be
english we could not do our work effectively on this committee without the support of numerous commission officials who investigate cases and instigate proceedings where necessary
english i wish to express our thanks
english we know we could provide a more rapid and effective service if member states could provide an equally committed response in replying to requests for information and explanation
english in one case we are currently dealing with it has taken months to get a reply to a letter
english that is not unusual
english that is why we are recommending that the council or relevant permanent representation should also be represented at our meetings so that they develop a greater understanding of the problems citizens face and respond effectively
english i would draw the council s attention to points and of the report if it was here
english the aim of the committee is to improve the overall quality of our feedback mechanisms
english some of our ideas are mentioned in this report
english others will appear in a further report in september from mr perry and mrs ke ler
english we are proposing as we did last year a database mechanism so that petitioners and members can track the progress of reports and see where the problems lie
english we trust that the relevant authorities will bear this in mind this year and act on the proposal
english there are various points concerning our relations with other committees
english we would ask them to call on the committee on petitions more often to express an opinion on certain areas where concern has arisen
english we would like to be involved in preparing joint reports on areas of particular concern such as the environment social security consumer protection and so on
english we would also wish to use the experience of our committee members through their work on other committees of parliament to institute a rapporteur style system for specific topics
english we are also keen to establish links with petitions committees in other member states with a view to exchanging good ideas and understanding
english we consider as a committee that petitions are a valuable and empowering tool for democracy in what can often feel like a remote and anonymous institution
english we need to value this mechanism and use the experience of the people we represent as expressed through their petitions to improve our work as a whole
english i commend the report to the house
english mr president commissioner and mr s derman the rapporteur s and the committee s understanding of the ombudsman s report for the year characterised by crises within the eu institutions and by an immense distrust of the administration is that the citizens will only view european integration as legitimate if they have rights that mean they can actively participate in a political dialogue with the institutions
english the political dialogue is not however a real dialogue if the citizens do not have the right to receive information and to have access to the documents that they ask for and if the opinions they express are not paid attention to discussed or taken seriously
english what has all this got to do with the ombudsman s task
english the ombudsman s task is of course according to the treaty to investigate cases of maladministration within the community institutions and within the public bodies
english at the request of the european parliament the ombudsman gave a definition of the term x maladministration x in the annual report for
english these cases occur when a public body fails to act in accordance with a rule or principle that is binding upon it
english during the ombudsman s last period of office the institutions agreed to apply this definition and it is now and will be in the future the basis for the ombudsman s activity
english in the report the committee stresses that this jointly approved definition of x maladministration x also involves the right to inspect how the institutions have interpreted community law
english irrespective of the legal form the charter of fundamental rights will take it will in any case be an expression of the member states common constitutional traditions which in accordance with article of the treaty shall be respected by the union and therefore also by the institutions and public bodies
english the committee observes therefore that the ombudsman ought to play an important part in implementing a future charter of citizens rights
english the committee has also expressed its clear support for the fact that the charter of fundamental rights ought to contain rules which give citizens the right to expect good administration within the eu
english x good administration x is the opposite of x maladministration x
english the right to good administration both with respect to the charter of fundamental rights and the code of good administrative behaviour which parliament and the ombudsman have sought should at least contain the right to have one s case heard the right to inspect documents the right to prompt answers from the administration and the right to receive replies supported by reasons
english all these aspects have been central to the ombudsman s work
english these rights are prerequisites for the active citizenship that is necessary if the eu is to regain the confidence of its citizens
english it is these rights that make citizenship active instead of passive
english good administration can create conditions for active citizenship whereas maladministration can undermine these conditions
english what are the most common complaints to the ombudsman and into which categories do they fall
english incomplete or refused information delays that could have been avoided discrimination lack of the right to defence
english citizens want to see good administration
english they want to be active citizens
english these conclusions can be drawn from the ever increasing number of complaints to the ombudsman and from the nature of these complaints
english the ombudsman has become renowned for his work for the wider public
english this is something he should receive a lot of praise for
english an investigation that he completed a few years ago resulted in most of the community s institutions and public bodies currently having legislation that allows the public to have access to documents
english he has tirelessly continued the work for real transparency and for its no longer being possible for data secrecy and personal protection to be used to prevent the public s scrutiny of the activities of the authorities
english step by step the ombudsman has developed his work endeavoured to obtain better administration and gained the trust of the citizens
english his cooperation with the national ombudsmen is also important as will be his future cooperation with the corresponding bodies in the candidate countries
english this is substantial work that parliament has reason to support
english it ought to do this by making sufficient financial resources available to the ombudsman so that he can carry out the necessary investigations which the mandate requires
english we should in the future also make sure that we support an ombudsman who is independent in his decision making
english i would like to address a big thank you to the ombudsman and his office as well as to the secretariat at the committee on petitions which as we know is currently working under difficult conditions
english mr president the european parliament s committee on petitions is a very special body
english it receives complaints from citizens as the two previous speakers rightly said who believe their rights as eu citizens have been restricted
english as draftsman of an opinion on the right of residence i would like to make a few comments on the specific problems in this area
english the free movement of persons is one of the basic freedoms achieved through european integration
english since the maastricht treaty there is a general right of residence provided the individual concerned has adequate means of subsistence and adequate health insurance protection
english freedom of movement and right of residence can be restricted only for reasons of law and order security or health
english experience has shown the committee on petitions that in practice the right to freedom of movement comes up against a great many problems because a member state authorities are slow to transpose the rules of community law b problems arise with the recognition of diplomas and qualifications in the case of specific professions c the rules on social security have not been standardised e g complicated forms for the refund of medical costs
english an analysis of treaty infringement proceedings between and shows that in cases there was a direct link between the petition and the treaty infringement proceedings before the european court of justice
english unfortunately the council often ignores the communications from the committee on petitions about serious violations of community law by member state authorities
english that reflects a negative attitude towards the european citizens right of petition
english in future the council should devote the necessary attention to the rights of eu citizens
english mr president the right to petition and to complain is not some recent invention
english even years ago petitioners could put their concerns before the roman emperor
english but this right was always in danger of being changed restricted or abolished
english yesterday s petitioners have become today s responsible european citizens
english no administration or institution is infallible
english many petitions point to a discrepancy between the legal provisions and european integration
english so petitions are a gauge for the relations between the citizens and the legislator and there are many levels of petitions
english a population of hamsters in an industrial area is of just as much concern to us as the ban on silicon implants or the introduction of a heavy goods tax
english i turn now to the ombudsman
english my group congratulates the ombudsman on the work he accomplished in
english it was and is to mr s derman s credit that he has done so much to create greater transparency and openness within the european administrations
english since most of the complaints in the ombudsman s remit relate to the european commission and concern a lack of transparency work needs to be done to improve this situation
english that includes access to documents not only for the citizens of europe but also for the ombudsman
english new office technologies cannot be used as grounds for the lack of transparency either
english comprehensible substantiated replies to the citizens create trust the opposite gives rise to distrust and a rising number of complaints that need to be dealt with which therefore in turn creates costs
english the ombudsman s proposal for a code of good administrative behaviour is particularly welcome
english the citizens have a basic right to an open and responsible administration geared to providing services since after all it is paid for out of their taxes
english in my view it is most important for the european ombudsman to play an independent role which can serve as an example for the introduction of national ombudsmen in the candidate countries and in my land of thuringen
english mr president mr s derman we in the group of the european liberal democrat and reform party and myself personally are proud that our ombudsman is courageous enterprising and able to act
english it is extremely important that we have someone with such integrity who has dared to stand up for openness and transparency and against the culture of underhandedness secrecy and unfortunately in certain cases of cheating and corruption which also exists in the european institutions
english only an open and public administration can win support among those who are working here amongst the politicians and among the citizens whom we represent
english the line the ombudsman is pursuing has a lot of support amongst the citizens of all member states
english it is an indisputable fact and there are several international scientific reports to prove it that there is a crystal clear connection between a high level of openness and transparency in the administration and a low level of corruption
english the opposite is also true a closed and secretive administration tends to foster a higher level of corruption
english that is of course also true in the european institutions
english that is why it is so important for us to have a completely independent ombudsman who can act independently and without being subject to any lobbying whatsoever or to interested parties attempting to influence him
english the increasing proportion of complaints coming from citizens also points to the need for our ombudsman who really acts in the interests of the citizens
english the only criticism that can be directed at the ombudsman is probably that unfortunately the institution is still far too little known in many member states and that far too few citizens are aware of this right
english this is probably something which i would like to see concentrated on in the future
english to summarise the ombudsman fulfils a very important function
english i would like to congratulate him on the work he has carried out during the year and wish him luck in the future
english mr president commissioner mr s derman it may be well to remember that just a year and a half ago there was a debate in this chamber over whether we needed a committee on petitions in general
english i am very pleased to be able to say that the committee on petitions has again shown its indispensability especially at a time like this when we wish to enhance the status of the ordinary citizen in the european union
english i genuinely hope that the commission on petitions succeeds in establishing good levels of co operation with the other committees in the coming year
english i believe that we will be able to draft joint reports on the most important problem areas
english with regard to the ombudsman he has truly established his position and independence
english the growing number of grievances is an indication that the public have found him and we members of the european parliament have often been able to guide people in his direction to have their problems solved
english public access to documents is an issue that will occupy us in the future and we have already had some valuable advice on the matter from the ombudsman
english mr president in one minute one cannot say much so i am going to take this opportunity to summarise
english firstly i wish to thank the rapporteur mrs lambert for taking up all our proposals in the debate
english there are therefore not even any amendments
english secondly i wish to say that at this stage nobody doubts that the committee on petitions and the ombudsman make an extremely important contribution to compliance with community law
english we see this every day in the committee on petitions
english like mrs hautala i am therefore very happy that the committee on petitions has survived the attempts to remove it since as well as demanding compliance with community law it is the committee which is closest to the citizens
english it is the committee which makes the institutions most visible to the citizens
english the greatest problem is probably the long procedure which follows a complaint by a citizen
english the citizen has to study community law in order to present a petition and then any response is delayed month after month
english the most important petitions deal with social and environmental issues which are the matters of most concern
english on some occasions mr president and i will end here when a complaint involves the eviction of a citizen or the destruction of a natural area the response arrives when it is too late to deal with the matter
english the speeding up of the process is therefore an important issue which has been taken up by mrs lambert
english mr president the radical members of the bonino list will support the two reports and they value and support the work of the ombudsman
english however we would like to ask the ombudsman a very specific question regarding the fact that it is still not possible for complaints to be signed electronically
english in our opinion this issue is relevant to all the institutions having a bearing on parliament s own work as well however in particular precisely because the ombudsman wishes there to be as much focus as possible on his work we feel that the possibility for the ombudsman to attach an electronic signature could be the first step towards introducing the use of this vehicle within the institutions
english i would just like to comment on an important statement which has not received due attention
english seventy seven per cent of complaints received concern the commission
english the ombudsman has told us that the commission has made no progress this year in the area of transparency transparency is an effective weapon against fraud and corruption
english in particular on december last president prodi undertook to find and propose legal and organisational solutions to give both internal and external candidates to commission competitions access to their examination papers
english would the ombudsman please inform us in the same way that he has informed us that europol needs more time to comply with the recommendation whether the commitment made by president prodi on december to making papers available by july has already been implemented or not
english mr president ladies and gentlemen i gather from the ombudsman s annual report that as we have now heard the main complaint of the citizens is about lack of transparency
english but it appears that not everyone concerned is aware of this problem
english the commission has submitted a proposal for a regulation on public access to documents which you mr s derman rightly criticised in public as not going far enough
english indeed there has been quite a lot written on the subject
english the spirit underlying this proposal can be gauged from the statement by the advisory committee of independent experts
english according to the experts second report like all political institutions the commission needs room to consider to formulate policy before it becomes public because policy that is made directly before the public eye is often bad policy
english as a representative of the european public i find this approach to questions of transparency and of policy making in general unacceptable
english so i firmly support mr s dermann s justified criticism
english mr president i would like to add my congratulations and thanks to the ombudsman for the report which he has presented this year and also to mrs thors and mrs lambert for their reports to the parliament
english all these reports particularly that of the ombudsman show the very reliable dependable work that has been done over the year
english the european citizens undoubtedly need somebody to whom they can turn if they have problems with the administration and in mr s derman i know that we have an ombudsman upon whom we can depend
english i saw that at first hand when i attended the seminar in paris
english it was very good to see the respect in which the european ombudsman is held by his colleagues the national ombudsmen
english on this side of the house we certainly believe the ombudsman should have all the powers that he needs to discharge his responsibilities
english on access to documents we happen to think that the views of the constitutional affairs committee are important but that should not be taken to mean that we have any doubts at all about the principle that the ombudsman must have access to documents
english in that he has our full support
english it is surprising that last year the petitions committee was at some risk and the report by mrs lambert shows the very good work that has been down by the petitions committee
english with our chairman mr gemelli we are now looking at ways of making the petitions committee more effective and more efficient in the work it does on behalf of citizens
english one of the important things that we will be bringing forward to the parliament is a code of good administrative behaviour
english it is important that citizens and the officials of the institutions know what is reasonable behaviour so that all have a standard to which they can refer
english i would also like to thank the commission for the support we have received in the petitions committee that has been very good and very effective through the year
english i hope under the french presidency we will get the same support from the council but that unfortunately has been lacking in the past
english mr president i should like to start by congratulating the two rapporteurs on their interesting comments
english with its ever widening circle of activities covering a broad range of citizens interests the european union is turning into a modern leviathan complete with the inevitable high handedness which accompanies every administrative mechanism from certain points of view it is becoming even more dangerous than the equivalent national government services
english that is because control mechanisms have not kept pace with the increase in activities
english there are three ways of blocking the dangers which result from this extensive administrative mechanism in the european union
english the first is to have more direct and more frequent involvement by european parliament in controlling the individual activities of the institutions of the european union
english the proposal by the rapporteur mrs thors that the commission include a section on reports and complaints in the annual report on community law and the proposed organisational agreement making it easier for complaints to be examined quickly need to be followed up here
english if the tenet of these proposals is extrapolated the suggestion is that the european parliament should in the future devote more time to these matters which are equally important if it is to enhance its status and its right to aspire to codecision with the council
english in more general terms it is time to see parliamentary control exercised on a different footing
english the second way is to introduce the european charter of fundamental rights as a binding charter guaranteeing european citizens immediate rights both adjectival and substantive which protect their interests fairly and which convert to the right to compensation in the event that their interests are attacked
english the increasingly likely prospect of a charter which amounts to no more than a declaration will obviously damage the credibility of the european union which while abundantly eloquent on the importance of transparency in the operation of its institutions as a basic policy objective and accessibility to european citizens as a basic factor in achieving it shies from recognising the rudimentary mechanism needed in order to achieve these objectives
english the third way is to strengthen and improve the role of the ombudsman mainly by giving him easier access to all the documents needed in order to conduct an efficient investigation
english at the same time the wealth of material in his report should be closely studied and taken as the starting point for the changes which need to be made to the modus operandi of the community institutions
english i wish the ombudsman courage and good luck for the future
english mr president i would like to start by thanking the european ombudsman mr s derman the two rapporteurs mrs lambert and mrs thors all the members of the committee on petitions and the secretariat
english we started from the premise that the purpose of the institutions is to serve the citizens and that therefore any breach of the citizens rights will lead to a loss of confidence in the institutions
english we are currently required to create a complex comprehensive harmonious functional legal framework and we must therefore also create judicial mechanisms such as the charter on rights a body of law establishing criminal civil and administrative law the agreement procedures for the mutual recognition of judgments passed by member states europol and the sectoral agreements the establishment of the european fraud investigation office as a tool for investigating abuse of the law the likely institution of the office of european public prosecutor which should be the investigating office of the court of justice the separation of the careers of judges responsible for giving rulings and investigating magistrates and the separation of criminal civil and administrative responsibilities all these are instruments which advance the progress of the european union
english yesterday s framework agreement is a milestone in this sense
english finally we would like to request that in a similar way to parliament in the codecision procedure the committee on petitions may be permitted to present its own justification for certain decisions and we call for amendment of the treaties in order to streamline the entire legal system and existing legislation
english mr president mr s derman commissioner ladies and gentlemen i would like to thank the rapporteurs for their hard thorough and excellent work
english the ombudsman controls power and solves disputes between those who hold power and those over whom power is exercised and last year there were almost two thousand such cases
english i would like to state seven principles
english the bigger a union is the greater the need for transparency
english the newer it is the greater this need is and the more complex it is the greater the need for better transparency
english the more oriented it is towards the information society the more open it has to be and the more civilised it is the more public it must be
english the more multi cultural it is the greater the transparency and the more democratic it is the more open it likewise is
english we are used to reading instructions for use with all equipment down to how to use the whisk in the kitchen
english the principles of good administration which have been worthily established by the ombudsman are our citizens instructions for use with regard to eurobureaucracy
english and goodness me these instructions certainly are necessary
english there is no democracy without good administration and that is why the union charter must contain the principles of good administration
english i would like to make one more important point public access to documents in the information society and the principles concerning them must be upgraded in line with the new technology in other words a grievance must be able to be made over the internet and precedents and associated documents must be available in real time
english my suggestion is that we need an ombudsman s portal on the net
english thank you for your work
english mr president as a member of the committee on petitions i would particularly like to congratulate my fellow member mrs lambert on her excellent report and i thank the european commission for its valuable assistance in handling the petitions we receive
english petitions are a recognised right of european citizens and residents of the european union enabling them to take advantage of the rights given to them by the treaties
english few citizens however are aware that they may submit a petition
english the files that we handle moreover show a lack of understanding of the rights conferred by european citizenship
english this unfortunately results in of petitions being inadmissible
english admissible petitions usually raise problems with freedom of movement setting up businesses social benefits recognition of diplomas and qualifications and taxation
english furthermore we are receiving more and more collective petitions concerning subjects relating to the environment and with the extension of the competence of the european union it is conceivable that the number of such petitions and the number of areas handled will increase
english in order to respond to citizens expectations adequate coordination between the committee on petitions the european institutions and national authorities is essential
english greater account must also be taken by the other parliamentary committees of the work carried out by our committee
english the chronic absence of the council from our committee meetings is detrimental to the correct handling of petitions
english indeed the national authorities are the first to apply community law and it is indispensable for them to work in coordination with the european institutions and in particular parliament and the commission
english we are currently waiting too long for responses from the national authorities sometimes even several years
english we are fully aware of the extent of this task and the difficulties to be overcome
english first of all it cannot be denied that this committee is not very well known although its work is indispensable in strengthening the link between citizens and the european union
english furthermore the structures and means of this committee must be strengthened in order to make it more effective and a closer relationship with the petitions committees of the national authorities would be desirable
english finally one of the strong points of the french presidency s programme is a europe that is closer to the citizens
english the work of our committee falls within this sphere and it is up to us to make this expectation a reality
english mr president i want to welcome mr s derman this morning and to congratulate mrs lambert and mrs thors for their reports
english the reality of our society is that if governments and administrations had their way they would never appoint petitions committees or ombudsmen
english by nature they tend to be secretive
english they are only there because the citizens and their public representatives demand them and defend them when they are there
english therefore it is important that we continue to demand that the ombudsman s office and the petitions committee of parliament are adequately resourced
english one way of choking off the effectiveness of the ombudsman s office and the petitions committee is to deny them adequate resources
english in parliament it is disgraceful that the petitions committee the single most important direct contact that the citizen has with this institution and with the other institutions of the european union is treated the way it is treated
english it does not have adequate secretarial assistance
english it is treated abominably in relation to translations which are down at the bottom of the list
english it is simply not good enough
english i would appeal to the commission and to the council if they were here they ignore the petitions committee as well as ignoring parliament to give the resources that are necessary for these bodies to do their job
english the petitions committee in particular is an important mechanism of access for the people of europe
english it is important that we ensure that it can do its work effectively
english the two most important issues that come before the petitions committee are the recognition of people s qualifications to work in other member states and the environmental impact of construction development
english in particular people are concerned that environment impact studies which are required under eu law are treated as having no more worth than the paper they are written on
english they are either ignored or they do not address the real issues
english mr president i would personally like to congratulate jacob s derman on the good work he has done which resulted in his re election on october last year
english at the same time i would like to praise the ombudsman for a model annual report which is easy to read and at the same time comprehensive
english it can be seen from the report that it is the commission that is the subject of the majority of the investigations that have been undertaken percent to be precise
english it should certainly be emphasised that this is mainly due to the fact that the commission is the institution that makes the most decisions directly affecting citizens
english in the report on individual complaints it emerges however that there is insufficient transparency
english insufficient and inadequate information was also the most common cause of complaint
english openness is important if citizens are to be able to have more opportunity to influence how the eu operates and if tendencies to corruption cheating and fraud are to be checked
english i would like to highlight the fact that this report emphasises that all eu institutions and bodies must establish a code of good administrative behaviour
english there is a risk however which is also evident from the ombudsman s annual report that the significance of such a code would vary considerably from one institution or body to another
english the pr side of the ombudsman s activities has already been brought up by other speakers and can never be underestimated
english i would like to close with some questions what would be the consequences of a charter of fundamental rights for the ombudsman s work
english are there sufficient resources for the work to be carried out well
english what are the main reasons for the institutions shortcomings in relation to the citizens
english is there a lack of will are the resources insufficient or is there unreasonable bureaucracy which is preventing and delaying the handling of this issue
english mr president on the basis of the ombudsman s report and that of mrs thors we may say that the institution of the ombudsman is well established
english the committee acknowledges the work done by jacob s derman and the public too have discovered the ombudsman
english the basic pillars of the work of the ombudsman are independence and transparency
english it is just as pertinent to emphasise the importance of good administration for the public and for the authority of the eu in the eyes of our citizens
english it is good that the committee supports the ombudsman in his efforts to create regulations for good administration
english the principle of good administration must also be included in the eu charter of fundamental rights which is being drafted
english from the report it appears that only around of the complaints to the ombudsman fall within his sphere of responsibility
english for that reason there has to be closer cooperation between the ombudsman and national and regional ombudsmen
english mr president ladies and gentlemen it is a pleasure for me to participate in this debate today together with mr s derman the ombudsman whose work in the service of the citizens of the union is very important
english the commission takes a very positive view of this work
english i wish to say that the commission believes that the citizen should always be the focus of our concerns
english the citizen is ultimately the beneficiary of our activities and is our raison d tre
english in this respect both the committee on petitions and the ombudsman play a key role on different levels and with different purposes but they are both nevertheless essential to the improvement of the operation of the institutions
english the committee on petitions deals with the specific concerns of the citizens and in this respect as has been pointed out by mrs lambert who i warmly congratulate on her report the petitions presented to parliament illustrate the problems of the citizens in relation to european administrations and also in many cases national administrations at the same time highlighting the legislative vacuums which exist on both european and national levels
english the ombudsman as indicated by mrs thors whom i also warmly congratulate on her report deals with complaints against institutions and bodies of the european union with regard to the deficiencies of its administrations
english he urges us to improve the management and quality of services by indicating the weak points to us the points which need improvement and greater attention
english however nobody wants a more effective and transparent administration as much as we do it is we who are responsible for this administration and to this end any criticisms of our defects are welcome
english we can only confront our defects if we know what they are
english i must insist that this is why we give such importance to the work of both the ombudsman and the committee on petitions so that the institutions may work properly
english with regard to mrs lambert s report i would like to deal with two specific issues
english one of them relating to cooperation between institutions is essential to the improvement of the operation of the committee on petitions and its capacity for action
english in this regard i would like to express my satisfaction because the report highlights the constructive role of the commission in the examination of petitions and because it considers it to be satisfactory on the whole
english it awards us a sort of pass and i thank you but we will try to improve
english we see this is as a stimulus to make a greater effort to work better and cooperate more
english secondly it proposes a review of the examination procedures of the committee on petitions
english it seems to me a great idea to rearrange the examination of petitions by themes to give specialised rapporteurs the task of examining these petitions with greater care and where necessary to draw conclusions which will allow the deficiencies to be corrected take decisions to resolve possible vacuums in legislative texts or counteract the unwanted effects of these texts
english furthermore the commission is prepared to consider a review of the interinstitutional agreement on the processing of petitions which would amend the one currently in force from with parliament and the council especially with regard to something that seems to me to be essential which has been pointed out by some of the speakers that is the problem of the periods prescribed for reply
english it is true that we sometimes take a long time to reply
english it is not always the commission s fault there are times when we are relying on responses from national administrations but it is true that in this respect we have to make an effort to improve and make an even more satisfactory contribution to the work of this committee
english i would like to highlight the importance of cooperation with other administrations we wish to improve this cooperation as far as possible
english the commission is open to dialogue both with parliament and with the council itself in order to reduce the time taken to produce replies and increase transparency and communication with parliament and the committee on petitions
english with regard to the thors report i wish to say that we agree with the need to consolidate the independence of the ombudsman as an institution and support his work towards transparency and openness
english clearly we consider that the principle which motivates decisions affecting the citizens is essential and we try to apply it in a systematic way
english we also accept the definition of maladministration as being when a public body does not act in accordance with a rule or principle which is binding upon it
english nevertheless i wish to say that as mr s derman has pointed out very well the ombudsman is a non judicial body and in that sense it can in no way substitute judicial bodies
english its tasks are different from those of law courts
english i believe that it is very important in the relations between the commission the ombudsman and other institutions and bodies to systematically respect the institutional balance laid down in the treaties
english it is true that the increasing reality of the institution of the ombudsman which in some ways is a younger institution than some of the other european institutions requires some time to mature so that the citizens may become aware of it
english the ombudsman in his report has indicated that the number of complaints investigations and inquiries over the last year have increased considerably and this is simply the result of greater awareness of the institution on the part of the citizens
english we also need time for the relations between the ombudsman and the other institutions to mature in order to establish the desired balances and resolve the obvious tensions which may occur until things are working properly
english however i must say that so far the cooperation between the commission and the institution of the ombudsman represented of course by mr s derman has been wonderful
english i would like very briefly to point out that these institutions are important because any action by an administration may at some time display a lack of transparency a lack of efficiency a violation of basic rights or even corruption
english however i wish to say that in no way can we portray the community administration as particularly laden with defects
english if we compare it with other administrations i believe that it compares very favourably and that we score highly in these areas
english ladies and gentlemen finally i would like once again to congratulate the ombudsman mr s derman on the work which he is doing on the significant increase in his actions and his work on his cooperation although he sometimes makes criticisms but that is his job and his role and we in the commission understand that
english the drawing up of a code of conduct applicable to the relations between community officials and the citizens is a priority and work is being done in that area by mr kinnock and the commission in general
english with regard to the amendments of the statute of the ombudsman the competent parliamentary committee must issue an opinion in accordance with article of the treaty and when parliament takes the initiative we will analyse all the relevant issues
english i would like once again to congratulate the two rapporteurs and of course congratulate and thank mr s derman for the magnificent work which he is carrying out with independence and rigour
english mr president i am grateful to you for giving me the floor to answer questions
english mr turco asked about the right to complain by e mail
english this has been possible with the european ombudsman s office for some years now since mr dell alba made us recognise that this would be important
english at the moment about of the complaints we receive are by e mail
english if you look at our website you will find a form which can be sent directly by e mail
english mr paasilinna said the website could be developed in that direction
english we already have direct access to all national or regional ombudsman websites but this could be further developed
english mr raschhofer spoke about the draft regulation on public access to documents which has been debated
english i should like to stress that this draft regulation is now before parliament
english the committee work can start
english in the discussions i have had with mr prodi he told me that he is ready to consider favourably all well founded proposals to improve this regulation
english this is now before parliament
english mr malmstr m mentioned ignorance about the ombudsman s office in some member states
english our difficulty has been that if we make too much propaganda about ourselves we get too many complaints falling outside our mandate
english so we try to find those citizens who have a problem with the administration and might have reason to complain
english members of parliament are a very important source of information for many citizens
english i would be very glad if you would take part in the work of making the opportunities for submitting petitions and complaints better known to the citizens
english thank you kindly mr s derman
english the debate is closed
english the vote will take place today at noon
english single european sky
english the next item is the report a by mr atkins on behalf of the committee on regional policy transport and tourism on the commission communication to the council and the european parliament on the creation of the single european sky com c cos
english mr president we meet at a time when congestion in our skies has never been greater
english according to the statistics the incidence of a minute delay has risen from in to in and is still rising
english we are worried not only about the effects that congestion has in terms of inconvenience and the implications for the economic stability of our union but we are also concerned first and foremost about threats to safety that may result from it
english it is a fact that there is a shortage of air traffic controllers
english it is a fact that there has been a lack of investment in air traffic control systems
english the demand for air transport is rising almost daily because of cheap fares the desire of people to travel abroad on holiday and on business or even to be able to take a few days break at the drop of a hat has added to this pressure
english whilst this pressure has been growing we owe it to those working in the system to congratulate them and thank them for what they have done
english unfortunately and this is not entirely their fault they are not coping with the pressures as well as we would wish we have all had experience of that only recently as a result of the delays caused by the strike in france
english all this then has a detrimental effect upon the mobility of our citizens and in terms of the economic and financial and social costs for our businesses and a wide variety of other people affected on a day to day basis by what is going on
english i would like to congratulate commissioner palacio for having the initiative to bring this to our committee in the terms that she did and with the force and verve that she has shown initially in setting up the high level group and also in the leadership that she has given to addressing this problem
english what has been produced by the commission is a major contribution to dealing with the saturation of airspace
english the council of transport ministers needs to take a political decision to address this
english we cannot put it off any longer
english it needs attention now
english we need a single sky over a single market but at the same time we have to recognise that individual nation states have views about how these matters should be addressed particularly insofar as they affect the livelihoods of the workforce and also the use of national airspace for military purposes
english military airspace and its abuse in some countries is something that we also have to address not just in terms of the space that is taken up by military aircraft but also on occasions the abuse of the civil air corridors by military aircraft not abiding by civil air procedures
english this too is an area which need to be addressed
english in this report i have proposed and the committee has broadly accepted a suggestion that eurocontrol should be a regulatory body with more powers more effective sanctions and with the right of appeal for those who are affected by it
english by the same token we think that the provision of air traffic services should be open to liberalisation subject to what each individual country decides is appropriate for itself
english as members may well know in the united kingdom we have addressed the subject by introducing a principle of privatisation
english that may be right for us
english it may be wrong for others
english it is up to individual nation states to decide but they must decide to address this problem of the division between regulation of their airspace on the one hand and the air service management provision that could be offered by others or other organisations
english we do believe that there should be objective and independent criteria on how the system is managed with incentives offered for the achievers and penalties offered for those who do not meet the desired levels
english we think that passengers should be compensated for unjust delays and that their rights in these cases should be clear and well known
english but above all we wish commissioner palacio with our support to press the council of ministers and all those associated with this to take urgent decisions
english if there is one across the board criticism of the report from the industry it is that perhaps it does not go far or fast enough
english this cannot last any longer
english we must address this issue now
english mr president i would like if i may to deliver very briefly a few comments on this report
english it seems obvious that we need to completely rethink the organisation of air traffic control in the european sky
english in this respect the commission s initiative is commendable
english a re think is one thing it is also obvious that everything must be carefully reviewed but i think we should beware of a certain number of preconceived ideas found in reports communications and speeches on this topic
english it also seems obvious that the political division of the european sky no longer corresponds to the technical requirements and market requirements
english i was extremely surprised to learn that in today s europe political boundaries still prevail when it comes to the organisation of air traffic control
english a european air traffic control space must be created but must this area be completely unified and according to which criteria
english i have many doubts as to the conclusions of the report
english it seems obvious to me that there are a number of advantages to dividing up air traffic control as air traffic control involves segmenting the territory and technical security limits but also human limitations mean that each air traffic controller each control tower can only have a limited territory and a limited number of flights to monitor
english in this respect the cellular segmented organisation of the european territory must be retained and in a way improved
english i am therefore in favour of an increase in the number of air traffic control centres as not the unification of the whole control system but the unification of the legal system and also technological unification takes place as this report and the research behind the report have highlighted the absence of european will x
english the president cut the speaker off
english mr president madam vice president ladies and gentlemen first i want to give very warm thanks to my colleague robert atkins for drafting such an excellent report
english he took great trouble not just to comment on the commission s proposals but also to outline them
english i regard the broad line of separating the regulatory from the operational function as the right one
english indeed in paragraphs and we note again that our parliament has now decided on two occasions that the regulatory function is to be transferred to the european union
english that brings me back to the last speaker
english of course we have to distinguish between possibly having several or many service providers in the operational field but the regulatory function must remain with or more to the point go to the european union
english nor is that in any way a problem
english today we have member states in the european union and more have applied to join
english if we start to proceed according to the eea system even at this point defining the common rules and then asking the candidate states their opinion we can integrate them
english that is why i also think it is a good idea in the present situation for the european commission to pool member states interests in regard to the regulatory function in the framework of eurocontrol
english we do not need multilingualism we need unanimity on the question of the regulatory function
english i really would strongly urge the commissioner to refer the proposals parliament will be deciding on today back to the high level group and to continue ensuring that this working group produces very sound practical results
english we have great respect for the vice president for she set up this group of military and civilian experts and the work is progressing well
english there may still be some resistance in individual countries
english we wish the vice president much luck and success so that come october we can submit an excellent programme
english mr president can i first of all on behalf of the party of european socialists welcome the commissioner s initiative
english we share her objectives we support her aims
english however we do perhaps regret the lack of integration with other initiatives that she is pursuing which is apparent if one reads her communication
english we also note the lack of political will that exists within both the commission and the council although it is worth perhaps reminding ourselves that this initiative started with the council in june last year when it requested the commissioner to bring forward this communication
english indeed in march of this year the council in lisbon sought further progress progress which i am sure we would all endorse
english the party of european socialists also supports and indeed welcomes the rapporteur s carefully judged position
english it is subsidiarity in action european where necessary national where possible
english i would like to thank him personally for taking on board many of our concerns not least in the area of safety which i acknowledge is now the number one priority for him in his report
english the key concerns of the pse include a regret at the lack of analysis of the real cause of air traffic delays
english airports runway capacity airline planning passenger behaviour airport infrastructure as well as the shortage of controllers which was mentioned by the rapporteurs
english a second concern of ours is this key principle which we support and which needs to be developed further namely the separation of regulation from service providers
english that has to be a key building block of our new approach
english eurocontrol too must be reformed and revamped and relaunched
english the third principle we support is liberalisation but not privatisation and fourth and finally we want to see these proposals developed in conjunction with the proposed european aviation safety authority
english indeed above all safety first should be our guiding rule and i am sure it will be our guiding principle in the months to come
english between and air traffic in europe doubled
english it will double again in the coming ten years
english we need to tackle this issue urgently and swiftly but in a coherent way
english what we want to hear perhaps from the commissioner today is a clear timetable from her as to the speed at which she will be acting in the months to come
english we all know there will be people waiting in airport lounges this summer asking why their plane is delayed not for minutes but for hours
english hopefully the commissioner today can bring forward a timetable for when those delays will cease
english i look forward to her comments particularly bringing this parliament up to date on the conclusions last week of the council which received the interim report of the high level group
english i urge colleagues to back the rapporteur s proposal and i urge the commissioner to bring forward a very clear timetable
english mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen sir robert atkins has in my view compiled a sound report
english he clearly indicated the direction we need to take because we find ourselves in an absurd situation where we have a unified market for aviation but over and above that we have an airspace which has been divided up in an illogical manner
english a number of meps have already described the effects of that
english it is obvious that if we want a single sky we need to make investments as the report clearly states
english thousands of people need to be recruited and investments made in technical infrastructure
english as such it is clear that money has to be earmarked for this
english it also means and i believe that this aspect is more complex that political decisions need to be taken very quickly and in reality these can only go in one direction
english we need to tackle the issue at european level
english we are all agreed that member states need to finally decide for themselves what they want do
english national airline services also need to realise that their time is up that we need to lift services to european level rather than national as this is the root of the evil if i can put it that way
english needless to say services need to come first because air traffic control does not exist in isolation it is a service to airline companies and its customers
english people sometimes overlook this aspect and only focus on their own patch
english if we talk about services within a unified market this means of course that monopolies are then a thing of the past that we need clear european legislation and that we must move away from monopolies in the service industry
english we are all agreed on this and i therefore hope that we can make good progress
english an important point as mr watts has already pointed out is safety
english nobody should compromise on safety
english as such commissioner what matters more than anything is that once the high level group has published its findings in october we need to receive proposals from yourself as quickly as possible i do not think that this will cause any problems for you
english then everyone will need to put pressure on the council of ministers member states will need to take decisions that need to be taken and take the course which we have indicated a few times in the european parliament and which is once again highlighted in sir robert atkins report
english mr president the report deals with the problem of increasing air traffic
english i want to focus on just one aspect of this report or more specifically on a major omission from it
english a number of proposals are put forward but for me the problem with this report is its main thesis that congestion can just be solved with the liberalisation of the air traffic management and control system
english what the options are doing is focusing on technical fixes not the underlying trends
english certainly a single european sky would increase the efficiency with which european air space is used
english improvements in air traffic management would make more space available
english restricting the use of military air space would also make a significant difference
english but none of these technical fixes are going to make a long term impact unless we address the underlying problem which is the unsustainable growth of air traffic
english by failing to link the issue of congestion with air traffic reduction the report misses out on a vital strategy
english it can be compared to rearranging buckets under the tap to stop a flood without considering the possibility of at least turning down the tap a little to reduce the flow of water
english consider the facts
english the commission s recent report has already said the growth of the aviation sector is unsustainable and must be reversed and that growth is forecast to double in the next years
english that causes major congestion problems but it also causes major environmental problems as well not only the noise and pollution for people living around the airports but also the impact on global climate
english air transport is already the world s fastest growing source of greenhouse gas emissions and could account for up to by the year
english unfortunately this report fails to make the vital link between congestion and air traffic reduction and therefore misses a vital opportunity to address these problems in a lasting manner
english mr president commissioner i think there is some ambiguity regarding the expression x single european sky x because air traffic control is in fact as you are well aware already a european field of activity
english there is already a european system for controlling the air space with eurocontrol and there is already a body the central flow management unit based in brussels
english this is not perfect of course but they do already exist
english the situation must therefore be improved starting with the statement which is patently obvious that delays have increased and that with traffic on the rise they will become worse
english it is recognised that there are many causes of delays but in the end i find that we are facing an offensive presenting air traffic control as the only reason for delays
english i believe it would be sensible also to concentrate far more on the problems of types of plane types of flow stopovers and of course the continuing defence related problems
english i feel as if we are involved in a headlong pursuit to implement solutions that seem obvious but that do not take account of the specificity of air traffic control
english mr zimeray said this earlier yes a plane journey is divided into different areas and the denser the traffic the more divisions there are
english why
english because dividing things into different areas is the human way of controlling or managing a number of aircraft
english therefore in my opinion thinking that there would be too many control centres is nonsense
english why not say in that case that there are too many aircraft
english in addition as far as i know there are no specific air traffic control hold ups at borders either
english the great proposal that is put to us for improving traffic consists of separating regulatory and control functions
english but what is the value of such a measure
english it may well be necessary to consider more relevant divisions why not
english but that is not what is being proposed
english the separation of functions would lead to the liberalisation of air traffic service provision establishing as indeed the atkins report states a liberalised internal market
english air traffic control is not an airline nor is it a market sector
english let it not be forgotten that its main function is to ensure safety
english i believe however that it is contrary to the interests of safety to subject aircraft control and monitoring bodies to market pressure
english the ability to invest in new technological tools and training must therefore be safeguarded
english in france and i am not trying to make france a model there is a general directorate that governs everything and in the past few years investments have been made and air traffic controllers have been recruited
english the system is highly effective
english on what grounds would you want to break
english the president cut the speaker off
english mr president this report takes as its starting point an observation which is familiar to all members of the european parliament as frequent users of aircraft as a means of transport the skies are becoming more and more congested as a result of the growing demand for this form of transport
english this surfeit of aircraft inevitably goes hand in hand with delays in air traffic causing frustration for passengers for companies for business and for tourism
english we share the rapporteur s opinion that air transport must be seen as a coherent system of operators airports and air traffic control services the component parts of which are directly interlinked and that only a study of this system as a whole will solve the problems of airspace capacity
english we therefore welcome the creation of the high level working group comprising both civilian and military representatives and chaired by commissioner de palacio who has committed herself to studying the issue of flight delays with a view to minimising the problems they cause
english she will in due course be submitting a report on this issue to the council
english our hope is that this final report will focus on drawing up viable proposals and practical realistic and effective solutions to the problem of air traffic delays in europe we also hope that this report will abandon controversial suggestions that contribute very little to achieving this such as advocating unrestricted competition between providers of air traffic management services
english we fail to see the connection between this so called liberalisation and the issue of delays which must be resolved as a matter of urgency
english furthermore any proposed solutions must respect the national sovereignty of the member states and restrict the centralisation of regulatory action to absolutely essential matters any proposed solutions must also safeguard the particular requirements of defence and the specific military needs of each country and honour the commitments that all countries have made in the framework of international organisations
english this does not mean that those countries are not obliged to make air traffic in high air space as flexible as possible and to seek more efficient ways of linking this with military operational needs
english the european air management programme whose purpose is to achieve complete coordination and integration of atm systems at european level must also continue to be expanded under eurocontrol the programme must be continued because the problem lies not so much in the way air space is divided up which could perhaps be justified in terms of ensuring that there is an appropriate number of aircraft and routes for each controller as in the technical harmonisation of atm systems
english mr president this is a valuable report it deals with a very sensitive and i would say extremely technical issue although the problem is essentially political
english there has been talk of the fact that there are too many aircraft in the sky that one controller has too many aircraft to deal with etc but we need only look at the united states of america which is the most advanced country in the world in terms of aeronautics where these problems are dealt with and although they may not be completely resolved adequate solutions have been found
english one basic fact stands out in particular the united states only operates one central air traffic control system while in europe there are still separate control systems
english we also have to take switzerland into account as well as the border countries all these factors are difficulties which we will have to overcome
english it is therefore right to call for a single air traffic control system at least for the whole of the european union which clearly needs to include switzerland for technical reasons
english this is the basic point and it will enable us to resolve a number of difficulties as well as promote technical development and here i am referring to the tcas gps and gnns systems which clearly facilitate a more even flow of air traffic
english i would like to finish by expressing some doubts regarding the application of the principle of subsidiarity it is a fundamental principle but one which is not always easy to apply
english along with shipping regulations air transport and air traffic regulations could genuinely be described as the most international rules in existence and it is therefore difficult to break the matter down into different areas of responsibility
english one last thing i see that the report principally targets the large air carriers and airlines
english let us not disregard other air space users such as air taxis private companies and private users flying club aircraft
english mr president commissioner securing a place in the transport market is an uphill struggle
english this is certainly true if the competition is fierce the pressure is on there are worldwide cooperatives and external cost items are considerable
english this is the situation which the aviation sector currently faces
english we need to consider the future of the sector for the reasons set out above
english in my opinion we should not accept unlimited growth as a fait accompli
english it is true that certain freight cannot be transported in a way other than by air but the vast majority of freight can
english we should tailor our policy accordingly
english this however requires long term efforts and specific effective investments in alternatives
english we are not that far advanced yet indeed the development of the trans european networks has been a mixed success
english we now need to look for alternative solutions in the short term
english in my view what matters most is using the available space in the most effective way both in terms of airspace and aircraft which requires both personnel and organisational measures as pointed out by the rapporteur
english by creating one single european sky we will provisionally have enough airspace to allow us to come up with structural measures to impede the unbridled growth of aviation based on the current state of affairs
english after all this is what needs to be done if we want to realise the ambitions of a sustainable transport policy
english it is important not only to facilitate but also to restrict where necessary
english although the rapporteur s initiatives are sound it is early days and we should not rest on our laurels we should keep thinking about the future of the transport sector and aviation in particular
english mr atkins report addresses an issue which is perhaps the most important issue which either mrs de palacio or we in the european parliament will have to deal with over the next four or five years and i must start by congratulating mr atkins on his approach in this specific report
english despite which there is clearly a huge problem here
english overall delays in flights have risen from in to in
english by the number of flights will have more or less doubled resulting in wasted time financial loss saturation and hence safety risks
english eurocontrol has proven to be inadequate as a mechanism for managing air traffic
english it is therefore absolutely essential that vice president de palacio take decisive action as she has done so far in order to establish a real single european sky
english the member states must overcome their perhaps justified anxiety as regards the management of their airspace and at some point must take a longer term view of newly emerging needs which goes beyond their borders and beyond the present situation
english we need to take immediate action and to regulate the myriad technical details such as relations between civil and military aviation
english in the meantime however passengers must be compensated for delays by airlines and must of course be apprised of their rights
english i should like to close my intervention by reminding the house that when the european parliament voted on the report for the intergovernmental conference it took view that the regulatory operation of air traffic in europe in our member states should be taken over by the european union
english mr president i thank mr atkins for his report and also for his willingness to cooperate and work with not only my group but other groups in coming up with this document
english there is no doubt that air traffic control delays are a problem
english a visit to any of the major airports at this time of year will make that obvious
english i hear that the average delay is said to be minutes
english all i can say from my experience is that somebody must be picking on manchester very badly because i have not yet flown with sabena from brussels to manchester when we have ever got anywhere near a minute delay
english i can safely say that the timetable now is just a mere guide not a definitive object when planning travel
english it is a clear problem that we need to address
english the report must consider all the issues involving air traffic and adopt a twofold approach as proposed by the commission
english but not all delays are due to air traffic controls
english it is the greatest cop out in the world for airlines to say to passengers that the delay is caused by air traffic
english there is never anybody from the air traffic controllers in the airport to turn around and say that is not true
english frankly a lot of the delays are caused by the inefficiencies of some of the airlines themselves
english passengers go missing
english it never ceases to amaze me the number of passengers that go missing in airports
english what do these people get up to i ask myself
english invariably they cause delays as much as air traffic
english the issue of eurocontrol is important
english we support the compromise that is made in point with regard to eurocontrol
english we also support the need for the military to give up some of their air space
english finally there are some tdi amendments with this
english i am particularly interested in amendment no
english i can only assume that the tdi group must
english the president cut the speaker off
english mr president i would also like to thank the rapporteur for an excellent report
english experiences from last monday reconfirm that this is a very important report indeed
english many members of parliament had a journey here to strasbourg of up to fifteen hours
english flights were cancelled and many were severely delayed
english this situation is absolutely intolerable airspace is badly congested flights are continually late and the rights of air passengers are totally non existent
english the report proposes relevant action that must be put into effect right away
english however i do not believe that it will be sufficient as air traffic is expected to double over the next ten years
english short flight routes must be withdrawn in favour of rail leaving room for longer flights as there are simply no alternatives to these
english reports aimed at improving the competitiveness of rail transport are from this point of view very important
english environmental levies which are being planned for air traffic should not constrict long flights unfairly but should work as an incentive to withdraw short flights in favour of rail
english mr president commissioner with globalisation we have discovered with pleasure that above all aeroplanes can take us from our own city to any corner of the world and we have enjoyed this so much that we can no longer live without flying
english however just as we discovered the congestion of our cities by motor vehicle it is now airspace which is becoming clogged too frequently we regularly suffer delays we lose our luggage and we have suffered all kinds of work to rule or trade union strikes
english we passengers believe that we must establish and defend our rights and manage our airlines airports flight timetables and air traffic control better
english however we often also think that we have to share the sovereignty of the air more amongst all the europeans and that there is a large section of the airspace with is reserved which we do not take social advantage of in the way that our times demand
english therefore as well as reforming eurocontrol increasing the number of radio communication frequencies and implementing new and better technologies for tracking so that more air corridors and more planes can be fitted in in these days of normality it is necessary for civil commercial aviation to be able to use the reserved spaces especially in the highest quotas and highest altitudes which do not usually have too much military use
english the citizens demand it and i believe that it is possible to find a solution which is perfectly valid for all sharing i insist sovereignty and the reserved space used by military aircraft
english mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen like the rapporteur and the previous speaker i think we urgently need to take the appropriate measures to tackle and eventually put a stop to the constant increase in delays in european air traffic
english the discussion in committee and again here in plenary today keeps centring on the best ways and means of changing air traffic management
english sir robert atkins for whose expertise i have enormous regard and a majority in the committee on regional policy transport and tourism believe the prime way to achieve this objective is through liberalisation measures
english liberalisation will without doubt increase the number of providers but it will not resolve certain problems and will even create new ones
english firstly so long as the member states give precedence to their justified national interests over the general european interest in regard to the coordination and use of european airspace we will see no radical changes
english secondly that is another reason for eurocontrol s poor efficiency
english no matter whether the regulatory and control bodies are separated or not whether you liberalise or privatise so long as there is no political will to accept that european airspace issues can only be approached on a pan european basis another ten reports will not help either
english thirdly priority must be given to the civil use of airspace
english in a peaceful and united europe there is not one logical reason for reserving a large part of airspace for the military
english fourthly do you not agree that if we make a kind of fetish out of liberalisation it is highly likely that there will be fewer and fewer service providers for less lucrative routes and that there cannot be fair competition unless we lay down binding uniform social and security standards
english fifthly we do not need the commission to use its influence on national governments in the event of domestic industrial disputes as called for in paragraph of the report we need a smoothly running social dialogue between all the players involved in air traffic
english mr president mr atkins report raises a number of real problems in the development of the air travel system in europe
english first of all the matter of safety
english the strikes that sometimes disrupt traffic take thousands of passengers hostage without proper warning
english increasing numbers of intolerable delays are not as has already been stated solely due to overcrowding in the sky but to also the airlines attempt for reasons of cost effectiveness to rotate their planes with excessively short unreasonable and ultimately impossible turnarounds
english the report however omits to bring up one fundamental issue the issue of traffic rights
english at the present time it is extremely difficult for a european company with a line serving for example paris houston and san francisco to board passengers in california as this is legally considered as cabotage whereas an american company serving new york madrid or paris may board passengers in spain for disembarkation in europe
english it is in the international negotiation of traffic rights that this concept of european air space x
english the president cut the speaker off
english mr president it has been noted that air transport is increasingly accessible to a greater number of our fellow citizens
english this democratisation is admittedly welcome but raises important questions for the future increased traffic overcrowded airports congested skies and lack of respect for the environment in particular in terms of noise pollution
english the desire to create optimum air traffic control in europe is based on good intentions but why should the commission challenge the air policies of the member states and their bilateral agreements through a single air space
english of course i agree on the one hand with the goal of rationalising the movement of aircraft and on the other hand with the goal of aiming for improved traffic flow while fully respecting consumer protection and passenger safety
english i would like to believe mrs palacio when she assures us that and i quote there is x no reference to creating competition between air traffic control services or their privatisation in the works of the commission x
english but in that case the staff concerned would have no justifiable need of trade unions
english the commission is demanding the advent of a proper air traffic management authority a strong regulatory authority i say no
english no to a complete overhaul of eurocontrol
english no to a new regulatory structure after all the current system effectively organises particularly with regard to safety a balanced flow of traffic while respecting the national systems which all states are entitled to no to the commission representing the member states with regard to external states thereby destroying any political decision making power in the field of air transport
english mr president madam vice president of the commission both the commission s communication and the rapporteur s report which is magnificent are in line with the european council of lisbon which asked the commission for a series of specific proposals as soon as possible
english it is now for the council to take the necessary and urgent political decisions which will allow the single aviation market to be supplemented with a single air traffic control system
english the growth in demand currently stands at between and and it seems that it will follow the same trend over the next few years this makes it even more difficult for the european air management systems to do their work since they have shown themselves to be incapable of dealing with this development and they are the cause of of delays although it is true that there are other causes such as the limitations of the airports and flight schedules which do not take account of the limitations of the infrastructures
english another cause which makes the current system ineffective is the different organisation of the civil system and the military system as well as the different standards of technical equipment on the ground
english the airspace must be accessible under the same conditions for general commercial and military aviation which does not mean that we should not give priority or indeed exclusive access to the military in the event of crises
english however the mere fact that a crisis may occur does not mean that certain member states can justify maintaining the conditions which prevailed during the cold war
english it is necessary for the civil and military controllers in the control centres to work in close cooperation
english there is a clear need to achieve more effective cooperation between the different users of the airspace and i believe that that cooperation and a joint approach should be sought at european level
english i congratulate the rapporteur and the vice president of the commission for the opinions they share on an issue which is so important and so sensitive in the daily lives of our citizens
english mr atkins report is detailed and balanced and it presents the current and correct position of this house
english lastly madam vice president please take note that we are aware of your efforts and we will support you in the line you have taken
english mr president i must express major reservations with regard to the atkins report as it bears the stamp of commercial interests concealed behind the best of intentions
english in actual fact the airlines would like the air traffic control sector to be completely liberalised not so much for reasons of safety interoperability or reducing delays as to be able to access a market of air traffic control services that would enable the more powerful among them to purchase more expensive secure slots and leave the problem of delays to other airlines and private aviation
english under cover of a single sky such liberalisation would actually offer us a multispeed sky
english i have no other way of explaining the witch hunt undertaken in this report with regard to civil air traffic control alone
english we all know that this only represents of delays which admittedly are worth combating but which essentially depend on military constraints
english this is a political problem that depends first and foremost on politicians
english we all know that the considerable increase in air traffic is the main underlying cause of overcrowded and saturated skies
english we all know that the number of runways and landing platforms would have to be reduced in order to have any chance of a break a simple break in the saturation
english finally in my country the airlines have chosen to set up shuttles that send a dozen low capacity aircraft from each provincial french town every morning between a m and a m to paris alone
english is it the fault of air traffic control if they refuse to allow all these flights to land simultaneously in paris
english these are the fundamental causes of air delays
english naturally the single sky must be set up through a reformed eurocontrol and harmonised control services at european level
english however personally i cannot imagine collective safety services that are dictated by profit alone controlled by shareholders
english in addition i cannot imagine tomorrow s single european sky becoming an sky shared unfairly between airlines
english commissioner i hope that in preparing the future directive on the single sky the commission will be able to handle this matter by taking a calmer and more impartial overall view
english mr president i am acting as the representative of the air traffic controllers protesting against the european commission proposal which in the name of the attractive slogan x single european sky x will clear the way for the privatisation of air traffic control
english the atkins report clears the way for the monopoly of private groups that have their eye on air traffic control which with the increase in traffic is likely to make money
english this reports mentions delays which are apparently increasingly frequent
english but how would subjecting air traffic control to the requirements of private profit possibly put an end to delays
english it is precisely the airlines quest for profit that has led them to make the choices that cause these delays
english it is in the interests of passengers and their safety and in the interests of employees in this sector for air traffic control to remain a public service dedicated exclusively to ensuring the smooth running of air traffic
english competition and the quest for profit in an area as sensitive as air traffic control will inevitably lead to disaster
english if it is necessary to put an end to national peculiarities with regard to air traffic management and if it is legitimate to unify the european air space this must be achieved by rejecting any idea of privatisation competition or quest for profitability and we will vote against this report
english mr president i really must congratulate my colleague sir robert atkins of the british conservative party on his most excellent report on the single european sky
english this proves beyond doubt that the overarching ambition of the european union is a single nation with its single national flag its single national anthem its single legal space its single national borders and now the citizens of europe will soon be able to breath single european air
english however after the failure of the single land policy known as the cap the single sea policy known as the cfp we can now look forward to a similar failure of the single sky policy
english not least given the number of strikes in air traffic control i suppose we can now look forward to the single european strike
english but you have struck a real blow for the eurosceptic movement in the uk sir robert i congratulate you
english mr president it is quite true to say that air traffic delays need to be urgently addressed
english however it is also worth noting that of atm delays recorded between january and june were mostly due to temporary capacity reductions associated not least with the kosovo crisis
english the real problem lies in the sectors straddling areas north and south which include switzerland france italy spain parts of germany maastricht upper air space and these are responsible for air traffic flow management delays and bottlenecks
english at one time greece was part of that problem
english however the impressive results by the greeks goes to show that the improvements can be made if there is strong action and real cooperation by national governments
english all too often eurocontrol is used as the scapegoat and is blamed for the present situation but the real blame must lie with the inaction of national governments in the areas that i have outlined
english it is quite clear that the european transport council must take immediate action to ensure that the air traffic control decisions are applied by all member states europe wide
english it should be remembered that eurocontrol is the only pan european institution in the air traffic management domain and must be supported
english finally one issue that was raised the critical shortage of manpower to the tune of air traffic controllers throughout europe needs to be urgently addressed by national governments
english that in itself will go a long way to improving flow control
english in addition both airports and airlines need to look closely at their practices as they too are responsible far too often for the high percentage of delays incurred
english mr president allow me to begin by offering my thanks to the rapporteur mr atkins for a powerful presentation to the commission for making this issue one of its priorities and to the commissioner responsible mrs de palacio for daring to translate words into action
english this has meant that the question of a single air traffic control has in a short time come closer to a solution perhaps than ever before
english of course there still remains much to be done
english in particular a number of reluctant member states need to be convinced but that is precisely why it is so incredibly important for the european parliament to give the commission its full support today for the continuation of the work
english we are of course in the middle of yet another chaotic summer for flights
english the development we are now seeing will result in a doubling of air traffic in the years following
english this assumes that we have had the necessary political decisions
english otherwise we not only run the risk of congestion in the air leading in the future to or minutes delay which we can perhaps put up with but are also in danger of no longer being certain of ensuring safety
english this is something we must never put up with
english it is in this light that mr atkins report and the commission s presentation must be seen
english the eu has spent a considerable amount of time and energy on tearing down borders and creating a single market
english everyone who travels a mile up in the air and we are there quite often can nevertheless see that there are borders everywhere
english the report lays down an extremely tight timetable
english i share this ambition
english let us together ensure that the summer of is the last summer with chaos in the skies over europe
english the commission can actually achieve this with the help of the atkins report
english mr president madam vice president of the commission ladies and gentlemen there has hardly ever been such a topical report as this one
english just in time before the summer break when everyone goes on holiday and more and more people also travel by plane today parliament is considering questions of air traffic
english a tiresome subject as we all know and as every air traveller finds out
english we all suffer from delays that often last hours
english it has now become a daily scene at airports to see every passage way overcrowded with bored irritable or even aggressive passengers
english it happens to us meps very frequently as it does to much of the population during the holidays
english let me remind you of another aspect
english when aircraft cannot land on time that not only creates a great many personal difficulties for people on business trips who have to keep to their schedules but also produces extra costs and environmental pollution
english so i welcome the fact that the commission has submitted a report on these important subjects and that a high level group was set up to consider the problems of establishing a single european sky
english i hope we will have the final results of its inquiries before us in good time in the autumn so that we can then really move on to taking concrete measures jointly with the commission
english the safety aspect comes top of the list for all passengers but especially for frequent fliers
english safety standards must on no account be endangered
english that is why we need better airspace control and protection
english eurocontrol must satisfy all these safety requirements but that means we also have to create the necessary framework conditions
english thank you very much commissioner
english the debate is closed
english the vote will take place today at noon
english health and safety of pregnant workers
english the next item is the report a by mrs dami o on behalf of the committee on employment and social affairs on the report from the commission on the implementation of council directive eec of october on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the health and safety at work of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding
english the legislative instrument that we are considering today in the evaluation report referred to us by the commission has run its course as far as contractual rights and social security systems are concerned
english thousands of female workers in various countries in the union have benefited from it but it is now out of date
english it is out of date because the ilo convention has just been revised and there is an expectation that most countries in the world will substantially improve their maternity protection
english it was and still is of course hoped that the union will continue to be in the vanguard in social terms in this area as in others
english but not everything is out of date because in terms of organisation of work there have been shortcomings in transposing the directive and even greater shortcomings in implementing it
english in most countries the three stages of job organisation are not being respected these stages are the employer should adjust the working conditions and or hours of the worker to avoid exposure to risk if that fails the worker should be moved to another job only if neither option is possible should the worker be granted leave as this reduces the worker s income and also her career opportunities
english by way of example i must tell you that in some countries not even a minimum period of recuperation is allowed for the mother which the experts say should be around days for a normal birth for a woman working in a normal job
english nevertheless there are countries that are not complying with these rules at all on the pretext that they are guaranteeing women a choice
english we think that women must be guaranteed the option of enjoying an appropriate period of maternity leave which they can share with the father but that the leave should be assessed and guaranteed according to the risk to her own health
english furthermore this directive does not provide for a link between its own risk assessment provisions and other directives particularly the framework directive on risk assessment and information for workers
english since there is no such link employment of women is subject to unfair criticism because the costs of maternity related risks apply exclusively to young women of childbearing age
english these risks are being underestimated and should not be a matter for the employer or constitute an obligation on the employer only when the woman s doctor informs the employer of her condition
english firstly because this is too late risks from radiation chemically charged atmospheres and poor working posture are well known now and all have harmful consequences for the health of the woman and her baby particularly in the first few weeks
english secondly these measures do nothing to protect the reproductive health of men and women there is a considerable degree of infertility in the union today over of european couples suffer from such problems which result from lifestyles shaped by the economic structures within which we live and also by the fact that measures are not in place to provide protection against these dangers
english an example of this is the extreme temperatures that cause infertility in women and men
english the union which is today in a position to do so should draw up and implement legislation to this end with regard to maternity leave we are aware of the costs to economic activity of proposals to extend this leave
english we also know that these costs are much higher when employing women but health specialists recommend that a baby should remain at home for at least five months protected from the outside world and above all growing up in a suitable psychological and emotional environment which will provide it with the necessary balance for growing up with a sense of security because it needs its parents
english parental leave should therefore be extended and if healthily divided between the parents will benefit them both
english the directive should also take the informal economy and atypical employment contracts into consideration
english finally i hope that the commission will tell us what it is intending to do in this area now that it has an extended legal basis which includes article and ex article this means that it can certainly cover other aspects mentioned in the report
english mr president ladies and gentlemen mrs dami o has drafted a very good report and taken good account in it of my opinion for the committee on women s rights and equal opportunities
english it is most important to everyone to improve the health and safety protection at the workplace for women who are pregnant have recently given birth or are breastfeeding both to protect the woman and to protect the unborn child
english this is a general social issue and must be treated with the greatest care
english the commission s report on the directive is only concerned with the technical transposition of the directive and does not look at the situation at the workplace which has to some extent changed or at the changed role of women in society
english the number of single parents has risen and women are more concerned with achieving economic independence
english the commission must submit a proposal for revision of the directive that takes account of all these changes and it must do so as quickly as possible this very year
english there is a considerable need to improve the legislation
english that applies to preventive health protection measures at the workplace for the mother and for the unborn child
english here we must avoid any risks
english any activity that puts their health at risk should without exception be prohibited
english periods allowed for breastfeeding should be regulated and there should be facilities for breastfeeding at the workplace
english maternity leave after the birth of the child should be at least eight weeks
english there must be clear rules on financial support both for the period of pregnancy leave and for maternity leave
english the question of reinstatement also needs to be clarified
english none of these necessary provisions must lead to discrimination against women or to a reduction of their chances of access to the workplace
english mr president ladies and gentlemen today we are debating the implementation of council directive eec of october which is one of the most important directives in the field of the technical and health protection of workers
english i well remember its genesis and the problems that were discussed at the time
english a positive aspect is that at that time irrespective of the dispute about the legal basis its importance to women workers in the single market was recognised and a first step was taken towards establishing minimum standards for the protection of pregnant workers and new mothers
english the commission report before us continues to show up weaknesses in the implementation of the directive which means we must increase our efforts to establish the protection of women during a special period of their life in law and in practice
english really it is very sad for a society to find we have to pay much greater attention to this area in particular
english so i support the call to revise the directive as soon as possible
english however we will not manage it by the end of the year
english some of the demands that will have to be incorporated in a proposal for a revision of the directive are set out in the draft amendments before us and the ppe group can therefore support at least some of them
english first and foremost they include the call for a strict prohibition on dismissal during pregnancy and maternity leave safeguards to ensure that on expiry of their leave the women will be reinstated in their job or given a comparable one and effective penalties for those who infringe that prohibition
english for women who want to or have to reconcile working life and motherhood anything else would mean penalising or unjustifiably discriminating against them in their occupational and private life
english seen in these terms the effective protection of pregnant workers and new mothers is one of the most important contributions to an active family policy
english with a view to eastward enlargement and protection in those countries let me also point out that the single market must not lead to discrimination against pregnant women and new mothers
english madam president commissioner i would like to start by thanking the rapporteur for her thorough responsible and unreserved report
english this is an extremely sensitive issue which is closely related to other matters which are regularly referred to such as the ageing population the demographic trend the low birth rate the right to health the right to work the right to motherhood and the social value of motherhood this matter cannot be viewed as affecting women alone they must be protected and supported by society
english the directive whose implementation in the member states we are assessing today is intended precisely to introduce minimum measures to encourage the improvement of the health and safety of pregnant women and women who have recently given birth and are breastfeeding
english the commission s evaluation report shows that the directive has proved its utility in that it has been of some benefit in a number of member states in certain areas of the issue such as leave on grounds of health and safety etc however apart from these points which are of a general nature we share the rapporteur s criticism of the commission s report
english this report was overdue and limited almost exclusively to dealing with legal and technical transposition
english there is a lack of concrete statistics and data on vital aspects of the directive such as the monitoring of workplace risk assessment for pregnant workers and the frequency of work related accidents and illnesses and satisfactory information is not provided on the coordination of legislative adaptation of specialist inspection penalties or scientific research for the detection prevention elimination and recuperation of professional hazards relating to pregnancy
english we feel that there has been a lack of serious monitoring on the part of the commission there has been a lack of coordination between the health and safety directorate and the equal opportunities unit and the ambiguity of the directive itself in this area has become apparent
english the delay in the production of an evaluation report and i would remind you that precisely because of the low minimum standards set italy was only persuaded to approve the directive on the condition that its implementation would be monitored very soon afterwards should have led the commission to put forward a proposal to revise the directive particularly in relation to certain aspects referred to by the rapporteur the length of maternity leave the increase in the duration of maternity leave where risks are involved a more precise definition of the concept of an adequate allowance the prohibition of dismissal of women during pregnancy or maternity leave with effective penalties the prohibition of any form of discrimination with regard to women s careers or the improvement of working conditions the implementation of all the measures necessary to safeguard the health and safety of woman and unborn child without prejudice to the woman s right to work or her career and encouraging breastfeeding through diverse measures
english in addition to taking all the necessary compatibilities into consideration when they revise the directive the commission and the member states should be motivated by the principle of non discrimination and the recognition of motherhood and fatherhood as fundamental rights which are essential for a balanced society
english mr president it is important that women have good and secure conditions during pregnancy and childbirth so that mother and child have a good start and it is important that pregnancy and childbirth do not reduce women s opportunities in the labour market
english we have a directive from which establishes minimum rights for maternity leave and women s entitlements to financial compensation when they are absent from the labour market due to childbirth
english the commission has now investigated the member states implementation of this directive and in her report mrs dami o quite correctly points out that the commission s report contains only a technical and factual assessment of the directive s implementation and does not provide an evaluation of whether the directive in practice provides pregnant women or women who have just given birth with better conditions
english she does not therefore think that the commission s report provides an adequate basis for carrying out a review of the directive
english i very much agree with the rapporteur about this
english i am therefore also opposed to our requesting a review of the directive now
english i do not think we should demand a new draft directive which contains the right to a longer period of leave together with demands for longer enforced leave and which lays down more detailed requirements for financial compensation in a way that does not take the necessary account of the differences between the member states social systems
english the existing rules make for great flexibility and most countries guarantee women better conditions than the common regulations require
english it might be wondered whether new regulations would mean very much in practice
english in any case maternity leave and financial aid ought to be given priority in the individual countries
english however i think it would be a good idea to obtain a better overview of what the circumstances are in the different countries so that governments can learn from each other s good and bad experiences and inspire each other
english mr president ladies and gentlemen the european commission is required to submit a directive proposal on measures for workers during pregnancy birth and breastfeeding by the end of
english the assessment of the existing measures which was intended to lead to change is four years behind schedule and fails to meet the requirements which the european parliament prescribed at the time
english the group of the greens european free alliance calls for an increase in the level of protection
english the report mainly focuses on institutional aspects
english in our opinion this report should also embrace the right to return back to work to the same or an equivalent job after maternity leave
english we are asking for the rights of pregnant and breastfeeding women to be extended
english in practice women are often discriminated against during this period despite rights on paper
english this is why we call for a reversal of the burden of proof
english employers will need to demonstrate that any dismissal or change of job is not linked to pregnancy
english finally we would like the commission to explain why at the recent ilo conference the member states failed to adopt the common positions
english how is it possible that the united kingdom abstained from the final vote which in view of the procedure is tantamount to voting against
english we would like to close by thanking mrs dami o for the work she has carried out
english mr president at a time when europe with the beijing conference in new york is emphasising its pioneering role in the implementation of the principle of equality between men and women it seems equally important to guarantee their freedom
english this freedom is achieved through a right to specific protection for women a right that is always related to their bodies in particular to maternity and more specifically pregnancy
english we are therefore pleased with mrs dami o s excellent report which highlights the urgent need to revise the directive
english her request for a formal ban on dismissal during pregnancy is essential and i will dwell only on this point
english it seems to me to be dangerous to allow employers any leeway in this field as they will always use it to their advantage
english today with the revision of convention the ilo is levelling down the protection of pregnant women by accepting certain dismissals that are said to be unrelated to pregnancy
english europe with mrs dami o s report and the revision of the directive has a duty to be a political reference for women s rights world wide
english mr president ladies and gentlemen i should like to start by congratulating mrs dami o on the magnificent job she has done on this report we were happy to contribute to this in committee not only by giving the report our total support but also by adding some amendments that were accepted in the final version
english we consider the approval of this report to be a significant event as we approach the summer recess for four fundamental reasons
english firstly we think it is unacceptable that women should suffer social prejudice or discrimination because of pregnancy or maternity issues
english secondly because we must more vigorously tackle risks to the health of mother and child associated with working conditions
english thirdly the idea of reconciling personal and professional lives the family and work in modern society is becoming increasingly important to those of us concerned about people s day to day lives
english this is precisely one of those key areas in which a responsible approach to reconciling these interests is called for
english fourthly because maternity policies must be consistent with family and childbirth policies generally particularly at a time when the crisis resulting from europe s ageing population is increasingly drawing member states attention to this issue
english we shall also be discussing some of the amendments and our position will be based on the balance that we feel has been struck in the report
english nevertheless we will not support all of the amendments because we feel that this balance is actually preferable to some of the steps suggested in the amendments
english we shall support the amendments suggested by our british conservative colleagues such as mr bushill matthews who drew our attention to the issue of small and medium sized enterprises which we feel must be taken into account when legislation is adopted whether at community or national level
english on the other hand however we hope that the british conservatives will back the report because although it is true that some of the portuguese presidency s conclusions highlight this issue i must emphasise that paragraph of the final feira summit text stresses the importance of companies sense of social responsibility
english for us portuguese christian democrats and conservatives this is a very important idea we believe that companies also have a certain social responsibility which they should build upon
english i would just like to add that we wish certain votes to be held separately as a means of improving the report some points in which strike us as rather obscure
english we do not view pregnancy as a social resource and there is one other point on which we would like to see a separate vote in order to improve the report
english lastly i would urge all christian democrat members to endorse this report by my socialist colleague
english mr president i wish at this point to express my disappointment at the commission s failure to adopt any position on the revision assessment and notification of directive on maternity protection as yet
english nevertheless although i wish to highlight the considerable harm that this omission has caused to mothers every cloud has a silver lining and this report which has been brilliantly drafted by mrs dami o is proof of that such silver linings exist this report will enable the european parliament to move ahead now
english the report clarifies concepts harmonises legislation at community level establishes shared responsibilities takes account of new risks in the way work is currently organised looks for incentives to increase the population in an ageing europe and considers pregnancy to be a natural condition for women and one which should be respected and protected
english it specifically notes the rights of women working independently or as teleworkers and highlights the growing concern about single parents who are becoming increasingly common in europe
english the aim of extending maternity leave to twenty weeks is an ambitious one which is recommended from a technical point of view and must gradually be implemented we must therefore prepare ourselves for this in economic terms by sharing out responsibilities through cooperation between states and employers and workers organisations
english in order to achieve the aims that are being proposed it is also crucial for us to encourage greater dialogue collaboration and coordination between specialists in health hygiene and safety at work so that a more suitable working environment can be provided for pregnant women
english the european community must strive to gain the support of applicant countries to ensure that awareness is raised as rapidly as possible so that the measures recommended in this report can be adopted since there may be greater resistance in those countries which could be difficult to overcome
english lastly i wish to sound a warning about point of this report because measures for protecting new mothers such as very long maternity leave may have unwanted effects as it may become disadvantageous for employers to employ women and they may consequently prefer to take on men
english the commission must therefore create a system for detecting fraud and for applying harsh penalties to companies practising this kind of discrimination
english mr president adopting a directive does not necessarily mean that reality is as we would wish it
english we have a good example of this here
english according to the commission s assessment the situation regarding the health and safety of pregnant women looks fine but that is certainly only on paper for is that also the way it looks in reality
english i am not so sure
english the pace in the labour market is more hectic than ever great efficiency is demanded and women are supposed to work as if they were not pregnant even if they are
english it is stressful and it is unhealthy both for the pregnant woman and the foetus
english we know this because investigations have proven this to be the case
english the european parliament and ourselves as representatives of the people are entitled to know whether the legislation we adopt also actually works in practice
english i think we have an example here of the commission s doing all too little in this area
english the message from parliament to the commission should therefore be that the work which has been done is not good enough
english it needs to be re done
english we must know whether the legislation is working
english the commission s purely legal analyses now already show that there is a need for further protection
english i think there is a greater need to discover what suitable protection consists in and there should be stricter rules governing dismissal during pregnancy
english the commission must go back to the drawing board set to work again and table the necessary proposals
english the european social model is characterised by the fact that we have a high level of protection
english this should be an area and this remark is aimed at the liberal group which has adopted a very different view in which the eu should have a big influence
english it should not be left to the individual member states
english women s participation in the labour market is a prerequisite of our achieving the ambitious goals we have set ourselves regarding employment and the modernisation of the european social model
english modernisation and efforts in this area are therefore important
english they cannot be left to the member states europe as a whole needs to attend to these issues
english mr president many women are discriminated against today in their workplaces
english we know that many lose their jobs when they become pregnant
english this is completely unacceptable
english the dami o report contains many good proposals but we in the swedish liberal party still have fundamental objections to the report
english i would like to say to my predecessor who spoke just a moment ago that in this parliament we ought more often to ask ourselves the question what should the european parliament actually be doing
english how much detail should we go into
english we believe in the subsidiarity principle i e that decisions should be taken as close as possible to the people they affect
english social policy is an area where the eu ought to have limited jurisdiction except when it is a question of free movement for citizens within the union
english every member state should have full responsibility and the right to make its own decisions regarding its social security systems
english maternity paternity leave and maternity paternity benefit are examples of issues that are not directly transnational
english we do not believe in detailed common european social legislation
english this does not however prevent member states from cooperating and sharing ideas concerning social issues
english the dami o report contains an amalgam of legitimate demands for proper security for women workers throughout europe demands for greater freedom of movement and a better functioning single market and demands for the national right of decision on the details of the socio political system
english in this connection the report contains an imbalance
english my final question is why should the european parliament decide that every woman in the whole of europe must have eight weeks off work when she has had a child
english i know several women who have gone back to work earlier there must be freedom of choice
english mr president mrs dami o the author of this report is justified in her criticisms of the commission as regards the delay in revising the current directive
english the report quite rightly laments the commission s failure to comply with the timetable set by the directive and the fact that there has been no assessment of how effectively the directive has been implemented the report stresses the need for a proposal for an urgent revision of the directive and suggests inclusion of various measures which we essentially support and agree with
english as a matter of fact in the discussions held in the parliamentary committees we tabled various amendments designed to guarantee the statutory right to take breaks from work for breastfeeding to ensure non discrimination in the workplace against pregnant women and women who have just given birth or who are breastfeeding particularly in terms of salary and to guarantee career progression and employment with particular emphasis on the situation of working women who have temporary or atypical contracts
english in general the amendments were accepted with the exception of the amendment on the payment of allowances during time off work and maternity leave which must be equivalent to of the previous salary and be taken into account for the purposes of calculating pension entitlements
english i hope that parliament will adopt this amendment
english mr president if the commission s intention was to improve the effective health and safety of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth it may be said that it has not achieved its goal
english the report has two clear shortcomings firstly the fact that it is overdue and secondly its limitations
english it could have been finished as far back as but even though it is late it could at least have clarified the wording of certain articles of the directive and defined the many undefined concepts which have given rise to numerous interpretations
english among the various missing data which would have been useful it could also have provided the results of the questionnaires sent to the member states and the results of the coordination of relevant laws and activities by the european standardisation centre
english the european parliament recognised the need to revise the directive as early as with the result that now given the need for a social market economy it agrees with the objectives of mrs dami o s report to link maternity policies to family policy and to remove ambiguity by practically and quantifiably enhancing the rights of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth
english mr president madam vice president of the commission the incorporation of women into the labour market means that at some time their working life will coincide with a pregnancy which sometimes means that they are obliged to take additional leave so as not to endanger their own health or the health of the unborn child
english pregnancy is a natural state for women which society must respect defend and protect
english society must care for working women in particular by ensuring that they remain in their jobs
english the incorporation of women into the workplace is a reality which cannot be reversed and women cannot be put in a situation of having to chose between having children and keeping their job because of the complications which a pregnancy may entail
english the ageing of the population together with the low birth rate in the european union means that this is an issue of enormous importance for all social operators
english as important as the protection of pregnant women is provision for breast feeding which is beneficial to the health of both mother and child
english the protection of maternity and breast feeding cannot be considered as a form of unequal treatment between men and women since maternity is exclusive to women and it is women who must be protected independently of the fact that some parental leave can be granted to men
english the member states must deal with the possible negative effects of this directive by making it easier for companies to employ young women by exempting them from the social costs during parental leave
english the directive must include a minimum leave of weeks with an obligatory period of at least eight weeks after giving birth
english a minimum salary of must be guaranteed with no loss of pension rights
english the ban on dismissal during pregnancy must be strictly complied with
english in no circumstances must pregnancy be a cause for discrimination against women
english the committee on women s rights and equal opportunities unanimously condemns the delay on the part of the commission which is even more serious given that it extends from to which is the period in which there have been the most changes in terms of women s access to work
english furthermore we believe that this deficiency in the legislation may be exacerbating a very serious phenomenon that is the rejection by young people of motherhood
english we ask the commission before the end of to present an amendment of directive eec and that that directive be applicable to all pregnant workers in all areas and occupations with no exceptions or conditions
english the new legislation must be clear and progressive
english it must provide for new working situations and also the new family situation of single parent families
english the pregnant worker must be provided with adequate protection which is designed for their specific circumstances but this should not mean discrimination or a reduction in their work opportunities but quite the opposite
english we must be able to provide the means for breast feeding to be compatible with work
english mr president in today s europe there is no room for a divorce between women and employment and much less a divorce between women and maternity
english mr president the commission report which i have read in great detail says in general terms directive eec has been well implemented by the member states and this is reflected in the low level of complaints about the rights of pregnant workers received by the commission
english the rapporteur has set this all to one side effectively saying it is irrelevant claiming that the original directive just did not go far enough
english i like some of the suggestions in her report
english i congratulate her for the enthusiasm with which she has pursued her agenda
english but in general it is not a health and safety agenda
english it is very much a traditional socialist agenda
english firstly her report aims to harmonise social policy across the eu rather than leave the detail to member states a point made with great force by mr olle schmidt earlier in this debate
english secondly it wants to improve the terms and conditions of employment for pregnant workers and new mothers by way of extra maternity leave and specified minimum pay levels
english neither of these are really health and safety issues
english she is proposing solutions for which there is no health and safety problem
english as british conservatives we confirm our concern about health and safety for all workers especially vulnerable groups
english we confirm our commitment to subsidiarity regarding terms and conditions of employment
english but we also confirm our concern to help more women into jobs rather than putting up further barriers to female employment
english hence we urge the house to reject the report
english mr president this text is important insofar as the legislation concerned has significant consequences for the well being of women and also children that is the future of our society
english in this respect we may well be surprised that the commission has waited as long as it has to present us with its evaluation report on the implementation of this directive and proposals for improving conditions for maternity leave
english it seems to me that in this proposal for a revision of the directive that we are asking the commission to present quickly it is essential to preserve the reality of three fundamental principles for women and their well being the prohibition of dismissal for pregnant women or women on maternity leave the right to a mandatory minimum leave and allowance during this leave to be taken into account for the purposes of acquiring pension entitlements
english furthermore it seems to me that this new directive should comprise substantial improvements in particular all women must be offered the opportunity to take weeks maternity leave without necessarily being obliged to take the entire period but the employer shall be obliged to offer it and a minimum of weeks after the birth in order to foster development of the bond between mother and child
english with regard to high risk pregnancies and the birth of disabled children it is obvious that provision must be made for specially adapted proposals offering an extension of the length of maternity leave taking account of the specifics of the case
english as far as definition of the allowance is concerned it seems that the figure to be considered must be at least of the previous salary and that includes for purposes of acquiring pension entitlements
english finally it is recommended that this text should correlate and reinforce the formal prohibition of dismissal during pregnancy and maternity leave
english mr president my compliments to the rapporteur for her work on protecting women during pregnancy and maternity a particularly difficult time
english this report certainly represents progress not just for women in general but also in that it safeguards family rights and upholds fundamental values
english the european people s party has always upheld the concept of the family the basic unit of society as the basis for european construction and the christian values from which it stems require that it be respected
english at a time when europe has demographic problems the institutions need to issue a firm signal to reassure working women who have to have sufficient peace of mind and the necessary guarantees to be able to opt for motherhood
english this is why it is necessary to have a sufficiently long period of rest from work before giving birth and even longer afterwards when there is a child to breastfeed look after and bring up
english therefore benefits should not be cut considerably during this period and pension funds should not be affected either
english i would add that as regards the matter in question self employed women should also have a guaranteed right to benefits which should be funded from contributory national sectoral funds
english finally i would like to express my support for maintaining the prohibition on dismissal of women during this period and also for the fact that the cost of benefits for workers on maternity leave are not borne directly by the company where the woman works but entirely by the state in order to avoid discrimination and penalising women in the labour market
english ladies and gentlemen i would ask you for silence not a religious silence but a parliamentary silence so that we can listen properly to commissioner de palacio
english mr president i would firstly like to thank mrs dami o for her magnificent report despite the fact that it contains a series of criticisms of the commission s actions
english i must accept these criticisms since they are true and are based on real facts
english however i must offer a justification and an explanation
english in order to produce this text the commission has had to rely on documentation provided by the different member states and unfortunately that documentation has not been provided with all the speed and efficiency which the commission would have liked
english that is the reason for the delay in presentation
english the commission obviously fully shares the parliament s interest in improving the protection of pregnant workers and those who have recently given birth
english the community legislation and the jurisprudence of the european court of justice still do not offer a sufficient framework although they are undoubtedly key elements to making further progress in this aspect which is essential to safeguarding the rights of pregnant workers
english directive was adopted before the treaty of amsterdam
english we believe that it is now after the treaty that we will be able to go further and take some steps forward
english that is what we propose and to this end we are going to prepare a supplementary report on the implementation of this directive which we will present in
english as the honourable members know well the commission last week approved its new social agenda for and it is within this framework that we hope to offer an adequate solution not only to this specific problem but also to a whole series of other issues
english mr president this is the last time this week that the house will be meeting in such great numbers
english i would like to draw your attention and the attention of fellow members to a very sad matter
english this parliament s reputation with the press is excellent because for the past twenty years parliament has managed to issue press releases for the written press twice a day
english this previous system has now been changed
english i had a brief look to see how the system worked this week
english the press release to commemorate former president pflimlin did not appear until p m on monday evening
english the report on the feira summit was issued on tuesday morning the report on tuesday morning s discharge sitting was issued at p m the report on zimbabwe tuesday afternoon was issued at p m the report on the european central bank on wednesday morning was issued at p m the same day
english this kind of reporting is not really of much use at all to the written press
english at that time of the day editorial staff have gone home and we are in a way generating old news
english i would ask you mr president to revert back to the old system and to ensure that the press releases the daily press releases not only appear on time but also afford a general overview in a decentralised manner for each language
english i would ask you to request the bureau to think about this very carefully and reconsider their decision
english mr president on a point of order i am sorry to delay the house when i know there is a large amount of voting to go on
english i have just discovered from my agenda that the vote on my own report is to be taken last
english i have not been consulted about this
english indeed i indicated earlier that this needed to be taken as early as possible in the voting because and as one of those involved in aviation i know this better than most i have only got one flight to get me home
english and so i am stuck
english so i throw myself upon the mercy of the house and wonder whether it would be possible to vote early rather than to vote late on the atkins report
english i have taken note of your request
english mr president if you agree to sir robert atkins request then i would actually suggest taking the votes in the order we ended up with yesterday
english that would be something else
english mr mombaur i have not granted mr atkins request i have simply taken note of it
english there is a fixed voting order to which i will adhere and i am sorry if some of the reports will have to be voted on this afternoon rather than this morning
english we shall now proceed to the vote
english vote
english mr president as you have said we will be voting on the compromise motions agreed in an informal conciliation procedure with the commission
english we referred the report back on may and in the meantime it has been improved
english by adopting this procedure vis vis the commission parliament has once again expressed our resolve also to achieve full codecision in the committee on agriculture and in relation to agriculture
english we have achieved it by adopting this procedure for the case in point
english i want to thank the commission for its cooperation in this regard and i hope the compromises we have reached will also gain the kind of support from the council and the commission that means they can only be rejected unanimously
english so the commission and parliament have jointly managed to establish a very strong position and i hope that will also serve as an example to the intergovernmental conference in nice
english mr president commissioners ladies and gentlemen i really want to give warm thanks not just to the commission but also to all those involved to all my colleagues on the committee on agriculture for enabling us jointly to achieve this compromise
english i would ask you to adopt this document today because otherwise the council would be able to take a decision on and july without having parliament s opinion since we would not be cooperating as faithfully as we should according to a european court of justice ruling
english so i would ask that we adopt this document today
english once again many thanks for your cooperation
english commissioner would you like to respond to the question
english commission de mr president ladies and gentlemen just a few brief comments
english i confirm that the commission accepts of the compromise amendments
english the commission merely has a few reservations about the legal wording and the order of the compromise amendments in the text
english but in terms of substance the commission will support them during the discussion with the council
english regarding amendment no i would point out that the system of voluntary transfers of quotas between member states can only be used once simply because otherwise it could easily undermine the allocation system
english regarding amendment no the commission takes note of the committee s concern about the level of support for long fibres but must just point out again that obviously it will be impossible to evaluate the situation in full if a report has to be drawn up on it only a year after the reform
english on behalf of my colleague mr fischler and the commission let me thank you for your cooperation i believe that the compromise proposals that have been achieved have helped improve the text and above all of course have helped take the situation forwards

english mr president ladies and gentlemen i regret having to take the floor in regard to mr kuhne s report but this concerns a very serious course of events
english this report which is about the discharge of parliament s budget as you all know contains a paragraph and a sixth indent
english this sixth indent concerns our group
english there was an agreement and all the group chairmen will confirm this between the group chairmen that we would not address concrete cases relating to individual groups in the report but that in future we will jointly endeavour to tackle any problems that may arise
english so in view of the wording in the report i tabled a compromise amendment on behalf of my group and it was indicated to me a few days ago that the rapporteur would approve that compromise
english we thereupon refrained from tabling an amendment that also refers to problems in regard to the socialist group
english i now hear that the socialist group evidently will not endorse our amendment no tabled in my name
english let me state quite plainly in all seriousness and with great regret that this means the agreement between group chairmen was given up
english fair play was given up let me also say that our group is disappointed not just i personally but the entire group
english if the socialist group does not support compromise amendment no and that is up to the group then let me tell you that this will be a very grave decision it is taking here today
english applause from the ppe de group
english mr poettering as you are aware explanations of vote are made after the vote
english we cannot start a debate now even if the matter is an extremely sensitive issue
english yes mr president i note that the law is not equal for all because i wanted to speak along the same lines in the previous sitting on the resolution on feira and i was not given the authorisation to do so and i did it at the right time in the end i remember that there was a general row in those benches calling for the rules of procedure to be respected
english this has not been the case today
english on behalf of my group i would like to point out that it is absolutely unacceptable firstly that a non existent agreement be cited and secondly that my group be threatened
english it makes no sense to put conditions on other people s votes
english i accept that one can defend one s positions but what is not acceptable is that in this action before the vote my group should be threatened in relation to an issue which has been voted on by the committee on budgetary control with the votes also of the members on those benches
english furthermore and i will end mr president by saying that there is no mention by name of any group in the kuhne report
english i recommend to mr poettering that he reads the report carefully
english applause from the pse group
english amendments nos and propose deleting the obligation to indicate the category of animal on the labelling
english there have already been discussions about the definition of the category in the management committee and the commission is confident that solutions will be found that satisfy the majority if not indeed all of the member states
english the commission therefore believes it is crucial to introduce the provisions on labelling on september
english to open up the whole debate again would delay their entry into force
english then the amendments could not be adopted
english regarding amendment no the commission has concluded that the draft regulation already calls for full certainty of origin
english so the commission sees no reason to adopt that amendment and it is also against adopting amendment no
english yet i would point out on behalf of the commission that it is possible even now to indicate the date of the minced meat production under the simplified voluntary procedure
english let me also point out again that mr fischler stated yesterday that after the discussions in parliament at first reading a large majority of amendments were adopted and have now been incorporated in the text
english the president declared the common position approved as amended
english ecommendation for second reading a on behalf of the committee on the environment public health and consumer policy on the common position adopted by the council with a view to the adoption of a european parliament and council regulation allowing voluntary participation by organisations in a community eco management and audit scheme emas c cod rapporteur mrs garcia orcoyen tormo

english the president declared the common position approved as amended
english ecommendation for second reading a on behalf of the committee on the environment public health and consumer policy on the common position established by the council with a view to the adoption of a european parliament and council directive relating to limit values for benzene and carbon monoxide in ambient air c cod rapporteur mrs breyer

english mr president as a people s representative i believe it is important for us to stand by what we have signed
english of course it is not particularly pleasant in terms of our parliamentary activities to have to withdraw something suddenly
english but the members of our group have different views on the subject of illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings
english that is why we have withdrawn our signature
english i ask you to take note of that
english parliament adopted the joint resolution
english resident in view of the time voting time will be suspended now and resumed at p m
english mr president i respect your decision
english but may i point out that it is extremely thoughtless to vote on legislation and the next report is a legislative report on a thursday afternoon in july
english mrs roth behrendt i must inform you that we have not just one legislative report but as many as four to vote on
english consequently if we wanted to deal with them all in the same way we would have had to have extended voting time well beyond p m and we cannot do that
english in any case we usually vote when there is a room available and not when there is not
english voting time is suspended
english explanations of vote
english mr president in view of the vote on the papayannakis report i should like to ask the commission to convene a conciliation committee next week so that we sort this out before the september deadline
english please convey that to the commissioner please as she is not listening at the moment
english schierhuber report a
english el there are serious reservations regarding the proposal to amend regulation ec no on flax and hemp grown for fibre because of the unfair allocation of quotas between the member states
english countries with an important agricultural sector and a high rate of employment in agriculture such as greece have been given the lowest quota limit for both flax and hemp
english we should like to take this opportunity to stress the need for an awareness campaign in the member states in order to overcome ignorance and educate the public about hemp grown for fibre in greece for example shops selling hemp fibre have been shut down by the police and small undertakings have gone out of business
english stauner report a
english mr president pensioners and elderly people are in favour of innovation even though it may appear otherwise and so as representative of the pensioners party i cannot help but support the inclusion of any rules leading to innovative measures when decisions are taken on the structural funds
english on this occasion after stating that i voted for the motion of course i would call and i do so willingly for in future the projects to be financed as innovative actions to include projects which are concerned not only with improving working conditions in the strict sense but also with everything which affects pensioners who during the period in which they are not working use the contributions they paid in when they were working and so this period is indirectly a continuation of their working activity
english virrankoski report a
english mr president i would just like to say that the radical members abstained from the vote on the virrankoski report because the council was trying to secure for its own budget the costs arising from missions conducted by military advisers or others within the framework of the cfsp
english since parliament has always taken great care to ensure that that cfsp expenditure is an integral part of the union budget with the result that it falls within the scope of the commission budget we are concerned at the way the virrankoski report departs from this practice and at the tendency to include cfsp running and operational expenditure in the council s budget
english this is why we abstained from the virrankoski report
english we voted against extra money for military advisers because we believe a peace policy needs peace experts and non violent conflict resolution
english stauner report a
english mr president i do not believe parliament should feel satisfied with what has been achieved so far
english in discharging the commission it runs the risk of losing credibility in the field of budgetary control and combating fraud
english nor am i sure whether people in this house actually realise that giving a discharge means accepting liability for damages
english it will be hard to explain to the citizens of europe why eur million of taxes were squandered on the flechard case and why parliament is letting itself be fobbed off with empty promises
english so everyone in this house who voted for the discharge to the commission is assuming quite personal responsibility for it
english we need hardly wonder why the citizens are increasingly losing faith in europe
english on behalf of my group i therefore want to state that we voted against the discharge to the commission for that reason
english da on july members of the union for a europe of nations group voted against giving discharge to the commission in respect of implementation of the general budget of the european union for
english the reason for this is that the present commission which has undertaken to implement an extensive administrative reform is not showing sufficient willingness to implement this reform
english the many cases of foot dragging delay and refusal to hand over documents to the committee on budgetary control together with the extraordinary fact that crucial reports and minutes are disappearing from the record offices where they belong are an uncomfortable indication that a form of administration is being maintained which is more suited to the age of absolute monarchy
english clearly the purpose of the secrecy is to protect the commission s members and officials from the penalties which are used in every democratic national administration and without which the european union s administration will never operate properly
english in the course of the debate on the report i have mentioned two matters which are still outstanding but these are merely isolated symptoms of a general malaise
english one year after coming into office the commission has still not presented any proposal for fundamentally changing the provisions in the regulations for public officials which provide the kind of legal protection for incompetence and dishonesty that is completely absurd in an administration which purports to be democratic
english the treatment of this report in the committee on budgetary control has also shown that some members of the european parliament are more concerned with protecting the commission against those citizens who pay for the eu s budget than with attending to the same citizens demand that their money be administered honestly and efficiently
english unacceptable pressure has been placed upon a number of rapporteurs and the shady operators who have an interest in preventing the serious examples of fraud and deception in the commission s administration from coming to light have not held back from making physical threats
english a number of meps have today voted in favour of giving discharge
english i do not believe that a great many of these meps are satisfied with the commission s economic administration but we have reached a point where the majority prefer to close their eyes to what is going on than to run the risk of their electors and fellow citizens becoming fully aware of the scandalous states of affairs which make themselves felt year after year
english i am convinced that in the long run the majority of meps will regret having been so indulgent
english de on june i as rapporteur recommended to the committee on budgetary control that we give the commission a discharge for the financial year
english today i voted against that discharge
english the deciding factor was the way the commissioner for budgets handled the flechard case
english this firm was suspected of fraud as early as
english nonetheless it was let off a fine to the tune of eur million
english nonetheless the commission continued to do business with it all those years without asking any questions
english now the italian financial police are investigating and it is said that the firm is involved in shady deals and the black marketeering of butter on a grand scale
english of course we must not prejudge
english but the commissioner for budgets does not have the right to refuse to tell us how many millions the commission has paid to this firm over the past years
english mrs schreyer promised the figures to the committee on budgetary control on may but has still not produced them
english she gives one excuse after another
english on tuesday she tried to make this house believe wrongly that regulation prevented her from presenting the figures
english the community budget is not a matter of secrecy
english if the commission refuses to render account our response can only be to refuse the discharge
english mrs redondo has asked for the floor on a point of order
english mr president i would like to ask for the vote on the report on the protection of forests to be postponed until the next sitting because today for unavoidable reasons i must leave this parliament at p m
english mrs redondo we have been unable to vote on a number of legislative reports because there is just not enough time and so these will be put to the vote this afternoon after the votes on urgent subjects as usual
english mr president i urgently request you to ensure in future that legislative texts are voted on first in the order of voting for it really is parliament s primary task to decide legislation
english i do not approve of the fact that we have suspended the vote after only an hour and a half today but i will have to accept it
english however i am absolutely against an order of voting that automatically means that legislative texts are not taken until thursday evening
english i ask you to alter the voting order accordingly
english as you are aware certain decisions are taken by the conference of presidents
english usually when voting time starts at midday it lasts for an hour
english today it started at p m and ended at approximately p m the votes on certain resolutions such as the european council of feira zimbabwe and the trafficking of human beings took a relatively short time
english the votes on the legislative drafts take up rather a lot of time
english in any case this is not the appropriate time to discuss this subject
english we will take note of your comment and pass it on to the conference of presidents for in the order of voting according to the procedure we have been following out of all the recommendations for second reading which engage our capacity as a legislative house priority is given to the drafts which engage our power of colegislation
english i am sorry mr president to continue from where i left off a moment ago and come back to what mr swoboda just said
english mr president i understand everything you have said but this week for the first time we did not have a vote at noon on tuesday
english that is a decision that was taken
english we were against the majority of the house had they known of it the rapporteurs mrs redondo jimenez and mr arvidsson and others would no doubt also have been against it
english but if we do this then we must also show some degree of flexibility
english among this rather smaller body of people i dare to say this most of us are experienced parliamentarians and we know that there are different kinds of sittings
english the thursday sitting in july is a particularly sensitive one
english we know that we may not be happy about it but that is how it is
english so i would ask you to check whether the four legislative reports that are still on the agenda and that do not need long votes can be carried over to the next part session
english mrs redondo jimenez herself asked the same in the case of her report and she has my support
english mr arvidsson all this relates to what i know about will i hope also agree so i would ask you to contact the rapporteurs and the groups
english mr swoboda has already said it and i can repeat it for my own group we will agree to these four legislative reports being carried over to the september part session or to a part session in brussels
english mrs roth behrendt as you are aware a request can be made to postpone a debate either at the start of a sitting in the morning or at the start of voting time
english therefore when voting time is resumed this afternoon a rapporteur or another member of the committee will be able to request that the report be put to the vote in september
english i do not have any objection to this
english mr president you are absolutely right that is the correct procedure
english but if we plan to do that and if it is certain that let us say mr swoboda or i or others move this proposal it would be only fair to inform the rapporteurs of this possibility
english in any case the presiding president will be informed of the request and will of course give the floor to any member who wishes to speak at that time
english ruhle report a
english mr president i voted against the ruhle report
english firstly it appears to contain an error for it mentions a budget of as much as eur million at least in the italian version which seems to me at first sight to be rather too great a sum
english there has to be an error of at least decimal points
english apart from this i would like to stress that in addition to the other aspects which are inadequate as the rapporteur himself states in his report which begs the question of why he does not conclude the report with a recommendation to vote against it it would be appropriate to give at least part of these funds to voluntary organisations which include many pensioners and elderly people who are willing to go out into the world and assist developing countries
english fr the european parliament during its sitting of april quite rightly decided to delay the decision giving discharge to the european commission on the implementation of the budget for the year
english this decision was legitimate insofar as the citizens of our nations have the right to be told how the money of the european union their money is being spent
english our group is entirely in favour of any vigorous attempts to combat fraud and embezzlement
english indeed the irregularities noted both those covered in mrs stauner s report on the questionable management of the commission and those underlined in mrs ruhle s report on the various european development funds cannot leave anyone indifferent and necessarily damage the image and credibility of the community as a whole
english in addition we must draw the proper conclusions in terms of sanctioning those responsible certainly but also in establishing far more transparent procedures
english as shown by the votes of the committee on budgetary control the reports by mrs ruhle and mrs stauner are heading in this direction
english mrs ruhle s report on the various edfs clearly confronts the commission with its responsibilities it demands more clarity for all future aid distributed by the community for the benefit of developing countries
english the desire to raise moral standards regarding aid policy and increase the efficacy of the use of aid is a principle which is now clearly defined and our group is pleased with that
english there is no question however of accepting that on the pretext of better monitoring in order to achieve a more honest and rational use of the european funds and i am thinking of african caribbean and pacific countries in particular that our action should be a pretext for also organising the unfounded trial of certain countries of the european union incidentally one of the main net contributors i am talking about france by means of a witch hunt which it is said targets certain high ranking civil servants of that nationality
english greater transparency is also our primary concern with regard to the finances of political groups within this house the citizens of europe moreover would not understand if we said otherwise
english we must also take note of the responses of our institution to the observations of the court of auditors and without delay encourage all relevant reform in accordance with the financial regulation and the principle of transparency
english in conclusion i will say so much is clear that we should not introduce confusion between the discharge procedure which represents an overall appreciation of the management of the european commission as laid down by the treaty and the handling of a number of isolated matters which although clearly serious are still only isolated cases and represent a low figure with regard to the total budget
english we must keep a sense of proportion
english equally as far as our group is concerned taking note of the further clarification we asked the commission for in spring in the context of the stauner report is no reason at all for our institution to then be affected by amnesia when it comes to tracking down unacceptable practice at the expense of our fellow citizens contributions
english our group congratulates the rapporteurs mrs stauner mrs ruhle and mr kuhne on their commendable efforts we should however remain alert and be in a position to observe what the european commission s attitude will actually be with regard to the commitments it has made
english our group therefore considers it necessary for the time being to abstain
english kuhne report a
english de i voted against giving a discharge to the secretary general because he gave misleading information to the political decision making bodies about the purchase of the asp building in brussels
english this wrongly gave the impression that the council and the commission had agreed to the building being financed with the help of the then property developer
english furthermore this wrongly gave the impression that financing the building with the help of the property developer was an indirect form of financing
english in fact in parliament directly indebted itself to a banking consortium headed by westlb for amounts of ecu million and bef billion without first publishing an invitation to tender for the contract in the official journal
english the court of auditors also found that the relevant financial regulations had been infringed
english papayannakis report a
english fr only after the mad cow scandal did we realise the need to improve the traceability and labelling of foodstuffs
english europe was very slow to react and was left far behind in terms of beef
english today on the basis of a unanimous agreement within the council we finally have the opportunity to show a little determination
english indeed the common position submitted to us includes a large number of the amendments adopted by this house at first reading
english concerning the mandatory statements indication of origin implementation dates minced meat and the optional system i believe that parliament should be satisfied the council has listened to us
english this is why i wholeheartedly supported this common position as it stood and did not vote for any amendments
english the debate has focused on a few specific points and in particular on the indication of the category of animal on the label
english certain fellow members have explained in good faith that this statement does nothing to contribute to tracing beef
english they are correct
english however after the series of food scandals which this house has always vigorously denounced how could we today omit to take account of the colossal role played by the consumer
english specifically mentioning the category is a response to a demand
english it contributes to restoring consumer confidence
english two types of information must be distinguished
english information making it possible to improve traceability but that is not directly intended to inform the end consumer
english as it is too specific it can really only be read by professionals
english it fulfils a health function
english it is on the basis of these statements that controls can be carried out
english we are therefore talking about setting up identification and traceability systems
english the second type of information is directly intended for citizens like you and me who buy their meat every day
english what do they want to know
english they want to be sure that the product they are to consume is safe the traceability and identification system will make it possible to guarantee the safety and quality of beef
english but the citizen would also like to know what type of meat it is
english this type of indication on the label is addressed directly to the end consumer and gives him intelligible information
english it is a mistake to say that this is pointless
english on the contrary this labelling is just as important as establishing health guarantees
english europe must give consumers back their confidence as they have been avoiding beef since the mad cow scandal
english the implications are significant for the agro food sector overall which has been struck squarely by this crisis
english these two types of information are not in competition they are complementary and contribute each at their own level to restoring the confidence of european consumers
english the confidence of our consumers cannot be decreed it must be won
english garcia orcoyen tormo report a
english it is a correct policy objective of the european union to ensure that businesses carry out their affairs in an environmentally friendly manner
english the community eco management and audit scheme known as emas afforded an opportunity to eu companies to secure accreditation that they are implementing good environmental practices within their operations
english what we are discussing here today is the revision of the original regulation which put in place the community eco management and audit scheme
english the criteria for inclusion on the emas register are very stringent
english the fact of the matter is that there is public reporting of the results which are carried out by each national standards authority within every member state of the european union
english each national standards authority carries out a comprehensive and full review of all the activities of a prospective applicant under the emas scheme that may affect the environment
english under the new regulation which we are discussing here today easier access will be made for small and medium sized enterprises to apply for accreditation under the emas scheme
english for the most part it has only been larger industrial companies which have sought recognition under the community eco management and audit scheme to date
english we must remember that the emas scheme is the european version of the international standard known as iso
english in essence this iso international standard is the equivalent to the iso for european companies but with the appropriate environmental slant
english it is the correct policy of the european union to ensure that all companies in europe respect the environment and ensure that the necessary practices are put in place to guarantee their operations do not adversely impact on the environment in any shape or form that is why i fully support proposals to ensure that easier access will be made for small and medium sized enterprises to be incorporated under the emas framework
english there must be greater flexibility within this system no matter how stringent the rules are to ensure that all sectors and all businesses in the european union have an opportunity to secure accreditation under the community eco management and audit scheme
english i fully support this programme and commend this report
english recommendation for second reading breyer a
english mr president i voted for the recommendation which sets limit values for benzene and carbon monoxide in the ambient air
english of course i am in favour of this in that whenever there is a danger pensioners and the elderly are always among the first to be affected for understandably their lungs are often in bad shape
english apart from this i would like to call strongly for there to be focus in the future not only on the air inhaled by the citizens but also on the air inhaled by those who work with dangerous substances such as benzene and carbon monoxide
english it would be appropriate for us to concern ourselves with this matter and reduce the working hours of those who work with dangerous substances to less than those of the other workers to enable them to enjoy an average life span
english i feel that the european union should concern itself in particular with the conditions and working hours of the citizens who inhale those dangerous substances against which we rightly protect pedestrians
english workers should receive even greater protection
english recommendation for second reading jackson a
english mr president i voted for the motion and i congratulate the rapporteur mrs jackson who worked so hard to ensure that this recommendation on the practical organisation of environmental inspections becomes a directive
english there is no point in parliament adopting hundreds and hundreds of extremely important and useful directives and regulations if adequate effective practical monitoring is not then carried out in order to ensure that they are genuinely implemented and are of benefit to all the citizens of the european union particularly as i said a moment ago when it is a matter of environmental health as it is in this case and when failure to observe the rules causes harm above all to pensioners and the elderly
english the principal aim of this recommendation is to strengthen the compliance with and to contribute to a more consistent implementation and enforcement of community environmental law in the member states
english this draft recommendation establishes minimum criteria to be applied in the organising carrying out following up and publicising of the results of environmental inspections
english it provides for environmental inspections of all industrial and other enterprises whose emissions and discharges on the environment are subject to particular authorisations or licensing requirements
english this would certainly be the case for all companies who receive pollution control licences under the auspices of the environmental protection agencies
english according to the text of this recommendation environmental inspections will include site visits verification of self monitoring by the operators of the controlled installations checking the premises the equipment and the adequacy of the environmental management at the site as well as the records kept by the operators
english two types of inspections are foreseen in particular routine inspections carried out as part of a planned inspection programme and non routine inspections as a follow up to complaints in connection with the issue and renewal or modification of various licences
english member states will be required to draw up in advance plans for environmental inspection activities covering all their respective territory and the installations within it
english these plans shall be available to the public under broader and wider information campaigns which are envisaged under this proposal
english under this draft recommendation each plan should define the geographical area which it covers cover a defined period of time include specific provisions for its revision identify the specific sites or types of installations covered prescribe the programmes for routine environmental inspections provide for and outline the procedures for non routine environmental inspections provide for coordination between the different inspecting authorities
english i would like to commend the rapporteur caroline jackson for her report
english in her report she is calling for this proposal to be translated into a directive which would have uniform application across the european union
english the rapporteur believes that only a directive can force the member states to introduce these inspection systems
english as a member of the committee on the environment public health and consumer policy of the european parliament i support the need for member states to establish harmonised environmental inspections
english the eu council must listen to the european parliament in this regard
english we must all recall that the european parliament has the power of codecision on environmental matters as a result of the implementation of the provisions of the amsterdam treaty
english the european union also has competence in environmental matters under article of the maastricht treaty
english santa maria da feira european council of and june
english el there are four important observations to be made on the portuguese presidency and the presidency s closing summit in santa maria da feira
english first the european union took another very dangerous step towards militarisation by pushing for an eu military and police force and by developing an atlantic framework for it to work within
english by contrast no positive action was taken to promote peace as the continuing quagmire in yugoslavia illustrates
english secondly it is clear from developments at the intergovernmental conference that we are moving towards a two speed europe rather than towards democratisation as continual reference to closer cooperation and various proposals to reduce the weighting of small countries in both the council and the commission illustrate
english thirdly the european union under pressure from the united kingdom in particular failed to reach a specific agreement and binding timetable on tax information leaving tax havens free to operate within the union
english fourthly the lisbon summit midway through the portuguese presidency gave another sign in favour of abandoning the european welfare model and changing to the american model
english da the danish social democrats in the european parliament have voted today in favour of the resolution concerning the conclusions from the european council s summit in feira on june
english we have done so because we should like to repay a good presidency which has set a commendable and forward looking agenda for europe as is also reflected in the section of the resolution concerning the follow up to the lisbon summit
english our overall vote cannot however be taken as implying that we support the desire for an extended agenda at the intergovernmental conference and the legally binding incorporation of the charter of fundamental rights into the treaty in this connection we would refer to our explanations of vote on these matters issued in connection with the helsinki summit the calling of the intergovernmental conference the european parliament s position on the intergovernmental conference and preparations for the feira summit
english i was unable to vote in favour of the compromise resolution mainly because the paragraph on taxation is a little too sparse and casts a biased judgement on what was really decided in feira
english parliament should rather have noted with satisfaction of course the determination of the heads of state and government to reach an integral agreement on the taxation package as a whole taxation of savings income business taxation interest and royalties at the end of at the latest
english we should have confirmed the need to preserve the competitiveness of european financial markets by the simultaneous adoption of equivalent measures in key third countries and identical measures in associated or dependent territories
english we should also have asked to receive the reports that the commission should present at regular intervals on the application of information exchange systems and systems for taxation at source from savings as well as the report on the basis of which the adoption and implementation of the directive are to be decided
english i would remind you that this was not the case
english i know that opinion on the tax compromise that we just managed to negotiate in feira is divided
english this is reflected in all the european press
english i cannot help but name a few headlines from french language papers delaying compromise on savings tax doubts on feira tax compromise superficial agreement fundamental disagreement lame agreement taxation at source coexistence nothing at all
english or from the german language papers brown the scot boosts london as a financial centre
english london leads the way in the eu tax battle swiss banks see no need for action all financial centres must cooperate to do away with banking secrecy
english the observation in the basler zeitung of june is also telling we are more likely to see the matterhorn crumble than the swiss electorate release bank staff from their confidentiality obligations and the bern finance minister become the tax collector for brussels
english in this context the headline in the echo of june which accurately notes that without sufficient guarantees luxembourg will block the taxation directive and that the exchange of information should also be applied by competing markets reflects what was really decided in feira
english the fact that our resolution complains about the feira timetable illustrates the ignorance or delusion of the authors of this passage whom i would like to remind of what the luxembourg prime minister specified in feira on this subject that is that with regard to taxation of savings there are still around fifty technical matters which have never been discussed by the commission
english in this context complaining that the timetable did not reflect the urgency of the problem is irresponsibly unrealistic
english a surprising expression sprang from the lips of the last president of the council when he presented the summary of the portuguese presidency to us on monday
english x we must not x declared prime minister antonio guterres x allow an intergovernmental drift to take place
english x the debate on a federal europe which has just begun again must take place as a whole
english is it not paradoxical to see the representative of the governments of the member states denouncing the risk of an x intergovernmental drift x in the european union
english the paradox is even greater as what is clearly obvious to everyone or almost everyone today is that on the contrary federal formulas and in particular the latest that of intensified cooperation inevitably lead to a dead end in order to try to resolve the inescapable contradiction between federalism and enlargement particular emphasis has been placed on the miracle formula of intensified cooperation throughout the portuguese presidency
english it was even presented here on tuesday by president chirac as a sort of universal solution with a x vanguard x of x pioneer countries x clearing the way for all
english let us note in passing with regard to vanguards the reappearance in the framework of european federalism of expressions which were previously widely used in other ideological contexts
english highlighting such a formula in lyrical and ideological mode conceals the real dangers contained in making the principle of quality majority voting the general rule thereby eliminating the rule of unanimity
english not only is closer cooperation itself vigorously denounced and rightly so by the small and medium sized member states as damaging to their integrity whereas sovereignty is a principle that guarantees the equality and respect of each
english however even within closer cooperation it is clear that the application of the principle of the majority in place of unanimity could create unbearable tension conferring a monopoly of decision making on one dominant country
english such that it seems that the qualified majority principle if it cannot be applied to cannot be applied to or either
english it is becoming apparent that the x miracle solution x is in fact a dual source of tension that could profoundly affect european cooperation
english this is why instead of closer cooperation which would inevitably lead to dangerous tension we propose differentiated cooperation concluded between sovereign states that are free to decide to sign the agreements they want in the areas they want provided that these are not damaging to the fundamental interests of their partners
english trafficking of human beings
english fr the lutte ouvri re members share the indignation expressed by the gue proposal which we voted on at the death of the immigrants in dover and of so many others who attempted to cross external or internal borders of the european union
english in order to put an end to a situation where poverty forces thousands of human beings to leave for lands where they hope to have a slightly better life we must put an end to a social system which in order to concentrate extraordinary riches in the hands of the few enforces poverty on the majority of the planet
english obviously a vote in parliament will not bring about this upheaval although it is an essential need for humanity
english it is disgusting that even in areas where current national and european institutions could actually do something they do nothing
english the dover tragedy happened between two european countries
english the barbed wire fence we are currently setting up around the european union exists even within the union for third country nationals and these barriers can kill
english it is not enough to denounce the crooks that make money by trafficking in human beings
english immigrants must be guaranteed the rights to which every human being should be entitled
english we must ensure the free movement of persons
english we must put an end to immigration policies that turn immigrants into some sort of subhumans with no rights if not into illegal immigrants preyed on by the police
english we wish to protest most strongly at the policy of the french government which revels in its role as president of the european union but which refuses to regularise immigrant workers who have become illegal immigrants as a result of unfair laws and we demand that their situation be regularised immediately
english mr president i shall explain my vote in writing
english however may i submit a procedural motion
english previously when members were present for the vote and an explanation of vote was made in writing it was possible to leave as the president used to state that he had received such and such a written explanation of vote on such and such a report
english now we have to wait
english yesterday i waited minutes to say that i was submitting my explanation of the vote in writing
english it is a waste of time
english what we are doing is already somewhat inhuman we vote from p m to p m and then we stay here until p m to say that we are submitting a written explanation of vote
english the parliamentary services told me that i had to be here
english perhaps you would have agreed x nevertheless could we not clarify things
english i understand that members who are not taking part in the vote on a report or resolution cannot submit a written explanation but why must those who have taken part in the vote who are submitting a written explanation stay here for another half hour
english could you clarify that
english mrs lulling whose fault are you saying it is
english your fellow members who are giving their explanations of vote
english if all the members here had given their explanations of vote in writing you would have had your chance rather earlier
english however your fellow members have the right to give explanations of vote on all the reports that we put to the vote
english mr president i would like to comment on points and in which it is claimed that the intergovernmental conference is the key issue in the run up to enlargement of the eu
english this is not the case
english the key issue is primarily that of how the negotiations with the candidate countries are handled and what result is achieved
english there is still no final date set and the candidate countries think that the eu is extremely imprecise regarding its position
english i would also like to comment on point the contents of which i think involve an unfortunate development in the direction of militarisation of the european union
english i am saying this also as a representative of a country that is non aligned
english finally i would like to comment on point which talks of a positive step towards necessary tax coordination in europe
english what sort of a statement is this
english in this connection i would like to quote the swedish constitution and its words about x the ancient right of the swedish people to impose taxes on themselves
english the sitting was suspended at p m and resumed at p m
english topical and urgent debate
english the next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance
english mr maaten has the floor for a point of order
english madam president i would like to take the floor at the beginning of the topical debate because in accordance with rule of the rules of procedure this is the right time to do this in my opinion
english indeed the next item on the agenda is a resolution on euro and hooligans and although we are certainly in favour of discussing this matter there are elements in this resolution which are still under investigation by the legal authorities in the netherlands
english in our view therefore it would be premature at this stage to pass judgement on this legal investigation
english i would therefore move based on rule to adjourn the debate on this resolution until our part session in september
english this rule also stipulates that such a motion shall be put to the vote immediately
english first of all mr maaten the article you are talking about only refers to one group or members
english secondly it does not directly concern the question of matters for topical and urgent debate as the very principle of urgent matters is to discuss them at the beginning of the part session in order to establish a framework for them
english this is not like a referral back to committee
english consequently the urgent matter is either accepted or refused
english if it is accepted we must follow the procedure through and the debate must take place
english madam president i would ask you to communicate to mrs fontaine so that she may make the relevant representations to the competent institutions the great concern in the gulf of algeciras about the presence for more than two months now of the british nuclear submarine hms tireless which has broken down apparently with a very serious problem relating to its cooling system
english according to the latest information it appears that they intend to repair it there
english the inhabitants of the area have expressed their complete opposition to its being repaired there by means of a joint resolution of the political groups which has been approved today
english from this house we urgently request that the british government immediately remove this machine from the bay and repair it in england where we suppose that they will at least have the appropriate facilities to do so
english mr bautista ojeda your speech will be passed on to mrs fontaine who i am sure will handle it with the utmost attention
english madam president there are nonetheless groups which support mr maaten s motion he has spoken on behalf of the eldr group and i endorse his motion on behalf of the edd group
english i would thus ask you to proceed to the vote in line with the rules of procedure
english no mr blokland the rules of procedure do not lay down that the postponement of an urgent matter can be put to the vote
english topical and urgent matters are a very specific case
english it was voted upon on monday and this house by sovereign right drew up a framework for it
english as soon as a matter becomes urgent it cannot be postponed
english obviously the arguments developed by you and mr maatten can be considered during the debate but i am not putting the postponement of this debate to the vote
english madam president you are interpreting the text in a specific way but i read the text and it does not make any mention of exemptions for urgent debates
english every item that is put on monday s agenda by the house can be taken off the agenda again in the course of the week should it transpire that on reflection fresh arguments have come to light
english new arguments have emerged in this instance
english we now know that the dutch justice system is launching an inquiry
english it seems clear to me therefore that when we decided to discuss this matter on monday we did not have this piece of information at our disposal
english we now have new information which we need to take into account
english i therefore believe that your interpretation of the rules of procedure is not according to the letter of the rules of procedure
english mr blokland i believe my interpretation is in line with the letter and spirit of our rules of procedure
english it is clearly stated that the agenda as we are talking about establishing the agenda is established by this house at the beginning of the part session which has been done
english regardless of this if new factors come into play these can be communicated during the debate to provide additional information for our fellow members when they come to vote
english however i stand by this interpretation which is linked both to the principle of the agenda and the principle of urgent matters
english madam president i simply wish to express my agreement with the words of the member from the partido andalucista from andalucia and suggest as a place to repair the british nuclear submarine the gardens of buckingham palace that is where they could take the aforementioned beast
english all the arguments have been expressed on the subject of this postponement
english i maintain my position and i now suggest that we move straight on to the debate on fiji and the solomon islands as that is what our fellow members are waiting for
english fiji and the solomon islands
english the next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions
english b by mr speroni on behalf of the technical group of independent members on fiji
english b by mrs ludford on behalf of the group of the europe liberal democrat and reform party on the situation in fiji and the solomon islands
english b by mr corrie and mr johan van hecke on behalf of the europe people s party christian democrats and european democrats on the situation in fiji and the solomon islands
english b by mr marset campos on behalf of the confederal group of the european united left nordic green left on the situation in fiji and the solomon islands
english b by mrs lucas on behalf of the group of the greens european free alliance on the situation in fiji
english b by mrs lucas on behalf of the group of the greens european free alliance on the situation in the solomon islands
english b by mr van den berg and mrs kinnock on behalf of the group of the party of european socialists on fiji and the solomon islands
english madam president what is happening in fiji is further evidence that the pathetic dreams of those who believe in a multiethnic and multiracial society are unrealistic
english indeed we can see that the conflict between the indigenous ethnic group and the immigrant ethnic group has flared up dramatically although it is true that there has been relatively little bloodshed
english the same thing is happening in the nearby solomon islands and all over the world
english the events in the great lakes region in africa the events on the island of timor and the current situation in the moluccas are all evidence of the fact that peaceful cohabitation of communities with completely different traditions cultures and histories cannot exist outside the good intentions of those who are for total globalisation
english therefore in my opinion we need to focus our efforts chiefly on protecting the indigenous ethnic groups so that the indigenous fijians do not share the fate of the south american indians or the indigenous populations of central and north america and to ensure that their culture is preserved by controlling illegal immigration so that what is happening there and has sadly already come about in the balkans does not occur in europe as well
english madam president we in parliament are rightly particularly attentive to areas where ethnic tensions lead to conflict and attempts to overthrow democracy and the rule of law
english in both fiji and the solomon islands democratic government and law and order have been undermined
english in fiji the aim must be to restore the legitimate government elected on the basis of the multi racial constitution which was approved by both ethnic groups indo fijians and indigenous fijians
english violence against property and people must cease and the hostages released
english the interim civilian administration installed in fiji does not meet the constitutional or democratic tests
english we therefore call on the commission to begin with determination the procedures to suspend development cooperation with fiji
english the beleaguered inhabitants of fiji are looking to the european union which they see as the beacon of democracy and racial equality to come to their aid
english we also warn the solomon islands that a suspension of aid may be needed there to restore democracy peace and stability
english madam president i want to concentrate on the solomon islands but first just a word on fiji
english my acp eu vice president is one of those held hostage and i would ask you to send a letter of support to his family
english the acp eu delegation went to the solomon islands to study the ethnic tension
english it was quite clear after talks that a coup was imminent
english why did it happen
english when we arrived we found a complete vacuum
english there was no dialogue between the warring parties
english the parliament was not functioning
english there was no law and order as those who were police by day were malaitan militants by night and they opened their armouries to the malaitans on the morning of the coup
english of guadalcanal is held by the imf group and only honiara city is held by the malaitans
english this situation is unsustainable
english the ethnic conflict is all about the expulsion from guadalcanal of malaitans back to their own island to severe hardship without any compensation
english as they did all the work guadalcanal is now at a standstill in both rural and urban areas
english the presence of mrs kinnock and myself did influence the situation for the better
english we created dialogue
english we had the hour resignation demand on the prime minister withdrawn
english we advised them to recall parliament and have a debate on the situation and this has now happened
english amazingly the leader of the opposition is now the prime minister
english all this happened because we pointed out the european union could withdraw aid if the coup took place at the point of a gun
english that aid is of their gdp
english but the country is bankrupt and the new prime minister will face the same problems as the last
english he must make the parliamentary structure more active work towards a cease fire and then have talks on compensation with outside assistance
english outside help will also be needed to regain law and order
english i should like to finish by thanking the members of the delegation office there who were so helpful to us
english madam president ladies and gentlemen it is true that the pacific always evokes images of paradise beaches coconut palms sun
english today the reality is far sadder
english the two coups d etat that have taken place in fiji recently in fact show unstable states divided by poverty
english the most incredible thing in this matter apart from the passivity of our institutions is that the pretext of interethnic tension is always used to explain such conflicts
english we are well aware however that the true cause is not just that
english in the solomon islands the vast majority of the population is melanesian and christian
english in fiji almost half the population is of indian origin but these origins date back to the last century
english moreover in spite of these differences all these people are at home in fiji
english i believe there are causes other than this ethnic conflict
english for example we deny the role played by those who make a profit from these conflicts multinationals and local politicians
english for the former periods of instability mean fewer social tax and environmental obligations as the state is very weak in these cases and conflicts favour the arms industry as the political groups need to get their weapons from somewhere
english as far as politicians are concerned the practice of pitting one group against another as for example the far right does in europe allows a political vacuum to be created or power to be maintained
english this practice is only possible because the population is poor and suffers from a lack of knowledge of other groups
english in this case the two conflicts should have enabled some people to take back or gain power that they could not win through the ballot box
english in fiji the coup d etat was fomented by a bankrupt businessman who used his distant fiji origins to legitimise his actions
english as for the new prime minister he is also from a business background
english in the solomon islands a sham parliamentary vote brought a new prime minister to power elected by the power of the gun
english these two examples support our vision of the conflict
english the joint resolution however is too sanctimonious and effectively wants to restore the previous situation
english as is all too often the case it does not refer to the true sources of these conflicts poverty and the underlying self interested role of political and economic participants
english from this point of view if we want to be really effective we must prevent further conflicts and to do so we must genuinely aid the development of education the local economy and local democracy
english this is how we might succeed in changing things
english madam president my comments will be on the question of fiji
english some days ago a number of ethnic fijian indians representing that community and the indian diaspora who are concerned about these conflicts came to the parliament
english they expressed their deepest concern about the situation in fiji about its symbolism and how it could affect indian communities in other areas of the world
english their concern was not precisely for the ethnic indian community it was for fiji
english fiji had a multi racial constitution in
english it was designed to solve the ethnic problems in the islands including the land issue and that constitution was unanimously approved by an ethnic fijian dominated parliament and blessed by the great council of chiefs
english it was a model for a constitution for a multi racial society and a thriving island
english clearly the lawlessness and violence has undermined that constitution but we must look more deeply at the causes of the conflict
english this house has to ensure that in those countries where we give aid we monitor the breakdown of law and order and look at the interests of those ethnic minorities who are in danger
english the concerns expressed are very real
english we have the ability to suspend aid if we believe that there is something going wrong in fiji
english myself and glenys kinnock and other colleagues who have met with the ethnic indian community want to help them find a solution to this conflict
english madam president ladies and gentlemen the commission has been observing the events in fiji since may with growing concern
english it really is discouraging to see the achievements of an entire decade put at risk
english fiji had a constitution that was not based on racism
english that has been abolished
english it had a democratically elected government
english that has fallen and been replaced by an interim government appointed by the military
english fiji has already suffered enormous economic damage at this point
english there is a risk that investors will lose confidence in it
english politically fiji which proudly wanted to give its name to the new year partnership agreement between the acp states and the eu risks seeing its relations with the international community of states worsen considerably
english it even risks being expelled from the commonwealth
english the commission is currently preparing a proposal to the council on the application of article a of the lome convention because in its the view the fundamental principles of the convention democracy the rule of law and respect for human rights are no longer guaranteed in fiji
english let me remind you that this proposal initially provides for consultations between the parties
english further measures or sanctions will only be decided in a second stage on the basis of the results of the consultations and how they are assessed
english so it is too early at this point in time to contemplate further measures or sanctions
english any response on our part should be well considered and targeted
english a trade ban as called for by unions in australia and new zealand would result in the dismissal of more than workers in the clothing and tourist industry and that should be avoided
english turning to the solomon islands here too the commission has been observing the deteriorating security situation with concern
english the commission supports all the efforts made by the mediators to ensure that the parties concerned can discuss the outstanding issues and differences of opinion openly and without the threat of violence
english the commission is ready to use its instruments to support the peace process as soon as the political and security situation allows it
english the joint debate is closed
english the vote will take place at p m
english tibet
english the next item is the joint debate on the following joint motions for resolutions
english b by mr pannella and others on behalf of the technical group of independent members on the need to stop chinese colonisation and adopt a new statute for tibet

english b by mr sakellariou and mr veltroni on behalf of the group of the party of european socialists on tibet
english madam president commissioner ladies and gentlemen i think we are preparing to vote on an important text on tibet and that today we have the opportunity to make a qualitative leap forward in this fundamental battle
english this is a battle of law and of international law
english tibet is occupied tibet was invaded by chinese troops in and since then has been occupied and colonised by the chinese
english i think that we must of course vote en masse in favour of this resolution but that we must also vote for the amendment tabled by mr thomas mann by the liberal group and by the group of the greens an amendment which asks our governments to consider the possibility of recognising the exiled tibetan government if within three years the chinese authorities and the exiled tibetan government have not ultimately signed an agreement on the substantial autonomy of tibet
english we can no longer leave the decision not to tackle the problem up to the goodwill or in this case the ill will of the authorities of beijing
english we must oblige them and through political action by parliament assert our determination to see this matter which has lasted years finally resolved
english i would particularly like to call on my left wing socialist and communist friends to stop using double standards
english we all remember the great battles to decolonise africa the liberation of algeria and vietnam
english look at the results today the latter is still in the hands of a totalitarian system a dictatorship
english today in tibet there is a non violent fight for democracy
english there is no reason not to do here what we did there what many of us did in those days
english today the matter of tibet must become a matter of law an affirmation of non violence by the international community
english china is a large country which has a right to democracy
english so much is clear but that cannot be a reason to further sacrifice the right of tibetans to live with their own culture in full autonomy in every area that must be governed by the people
english i therefore sincerely invite my socialist and communist friends to vote for this resolution and this amendment in order to make sure that at least this once parliament is at the forefront of this battle for freedom democracy and non violence
english madam president happy birthday dalai lama
english but i am not sure that today is such a happy day for him because after all the most valuable contribution which the eu can make to the world is standing up for human rights and democracy and these are still being flouted in tibet
english in the light of this i would like to make the following observations
english first of all why is it that there is still no real dialogue at official level between the chinese government and the tibetan government in exile
english all manner of so called indirect contacts have led to nothing
english the european parliament should adopt a harder line in order to support the principle of non violence this is why this resolution is necessary
english secondly how can a renowned institution such as the world bank be on the brink of financing a chinese programme which is tantamount to a common or garden colonisation of tibet
english this has to be prevented and hence this resolution
english thirdly how can the european union possibly be one to let economic interests prevail in its relations with china
english surely we cannot offer the tibetan population attention only when it suits us
english in sum madam president i would urge you to ensure that a real dialogue is established according to the dalai lama s five point peace plan it will then be a happy day for tibet s entire population
english mr president commissioner verheugen ladies and gentlemen tomorrow the world bank will be taking a decision with very serious implications for tibet
english the aim is to provide international support to alleviate the poverty in western china and surely everyone is prepared in principle to help those who cannot do much to help themselves
english in the framework of this project however people are to be forcibly resettled in tibet resettlement on that scale might well gradually turn the tibetans into a minority in their own homeland after decades of destruction of their culture and their monasteries of persecution and threat to life and limb
english a fortnight ago the members of our intergroup on tibet and many other meps urged the president of the world bank in washington not to go against the bank s own principles for the protection of endangered peoples
english we have written to the national parliaments to the ministries of finance in europe the usa and other continents and of course to commissioner chris patten
english we have urgently requested the members of the board of the world bank to study the report drawn by independent inspectors very carefully first
english for the inspectors seriously doubt whether the resettlement is environmentally correct or socially acceptable because of an irrigation programme
english if public monies are spent the justification for doing so must be made just as public
english strengthened by its planned membership of wto china as i myself recently found in beijing is becoming increasingly aware of its role as an emerging world power
english but that also implies an obligation to act more responsibly than before and for instance to apply the concept of x one china many systems x
english the full autonomy granted to tibet must finally be guaranteed
english that includes freedom of religion freedom of opinion cultural and social independence
english bilateral talks must be held with authorised leaders
english the dalai lama is available for this at any time
english as my colleague pointed out this nobel peace prize winner who is accepted worldwide is celebrating his th birthday today and has been the tibetans leader for precisely years
english his five point peace plan which reflects his profound belief in non violence remains as valid as ever
english it is high time to hold constructive dialogues on that basis
english on behalf of the epp group and the intergroup on tibet i call on all the members of the european parliament to support our resolution
english only a worldwide protest shortly before the world bank s decision which is in fact due tomorrow can prevent things from going seriously off course
english tashi delek
english madam president commissioner ladies and gentlemen we are just about to vote for the thirteenth time on a resolution concerning tibet and we have to say if we examine the effect these have had in the past it is exceptionally poor
english this is why i am addressing the commissioner
english i would like the european union with its three powerful institutions to join forces and appeal to world opinion the chinese authorities and especially the world bank
english as fellow meps have already explained we need to put a stop to internal colonisation this brutal murder of the cultural identity of the tibetan population
english that is only possible if the world bank stops financing precisely the opposite namely the import of chinese people with a view to destroying tibet s original culture
english how can we justify spending taxpayers money on this kind of practice
english i hope you will help us bring about a u turn as requested by my fellow meps in the amendment a u turn which prescribes that if there is no change in three years time we will eventually decide to recognise tibet s provisional government rather than continue to tread water
english in our opinion it is essential for parliament to speak out against the world bank s decision
english we call upon the governments to do everything in their power and use every avenue available to them economic and otherwise in view of the fact that china wants to join the wto etc to ensure that china respects tibet s autonomy and that negotiations are resumed as soon as possible between the chinese government and the dalai lama with the intention of establishing a new statute for tibet this is the first point of our conclusions in this resolution
english the negotiations must be based on the dalai lama s five point programme which has our full support we would also like to wish him a happy birthday
english madam president years on we have been celebrating over the last few years the end of the war the founding of the united nations the founding of the world health organisation the return of independence to the baltic nations from the soviet empire but sadly also years on we have to commemorate china s illegal occupation of tibet fifty years of suppression and oppression of the tibetan people by the chinese regime
english that must never be allowed to become a fait accompli hence the amendment to this resolution to put pressure on china which i warmly support
english hence also the overall resolution to demand of the world bank that it withdraw its support for our so called project which would mean the movement of some chinese into an area currently populated by tibetans making a living with their herds and the exploitation of tibet s natural resources
english both actions are immoral both are against international law both demand action by this parliament and this union on behalf of tibet and its people
english mr president to begin with i would like to say that i am speaking today on behalf of the nordic green left party
english we think that the tibetans should have the autonomy that they themselves are striving for
english we are also concerned about china s unwillingness to participate in a dialogue
english i would like to address the commissioner and say that i hope that the commission has very good relations with the representatives of the world bank
english decisions must of course be made by no later than tomorrow
english we have therefore only got an extremely short time in which to influence the world bank to which this resolution is of course primarily directed
english it is of course usually quite difficult to have any influence on the world bank at all
english i would therefore like to be told formally whether it is possible for parliament to wield any influence at all or whether we should try in the course of the night to get hold of our government representatives
english the council is of course not represented here to any great extent
english i have had occasion to witness the situation in tibet personally it is far more serious humiliating and painful than it is possible to describe in this chamber or at any other meeting
english for the last forty years the chinese have forcibly denied the tibetans their freedom they have deprived them of their identity and what is more trampled on the human rights and dignity of the people
english that is why it is necessary for a parliament which is so concerned with human rights and combating xenophobia and racism to call upon china to negotiate another statute recognising the rights of the tibetans in full and genuinely guaranteeing the full autonomy of the tibetan people
english i would like to be totally clear even at the risk of appearing antagonistic
english we must guard against hypocrisy it is in fact pointless to adopt a joint resolution full of good principles fine words and indignation if for economic and commercial reasons maybe we then allow the supreme chinese authorities to be welcomed with the highest honours by our ministers or the mayors of the various european capitals as is actually going to happen tomorrow in rome when mr rutelli who is mayor of rome as well as a member of the european parliament will officially receive the chinese prime minister or at any rate a delegation
english if we continue to sacrifice principles and rights in the name of the economy apart from making pious declarations of intent in parliamentary debates it will be extremely difficult to find a genuine solution for the tibetan people
english madam president the commission like parliament is deeply concerned about the human rights situation in tibet
english we are particularly concerned about respect on the part of the chinese authorities for the cultural linguistic and religious identity of the autonomous region of tibet
english we have raised this issue repeatedly during the bilateral dialogue with china on the subject of human rights
english in particular the european union has called on china to resume the dialogue with the dalai lama as soon as possible
english in our view a direct dialogue between the dalai lama and the chinese authorities is the only realistic way of achieving a lasting and peaceful solution to the issue of tibet
english with regard to cooperation the european union takes the view that it is in the interest of the tibetan people that we support aid projects in tibet provided the group of ethnic tibetans benefits directly from them and is given priority in the management of the projects
english that is precisely what happened in the past when the chinese authorities gave an official assurance to that effect
english on the question of the world bank project i can inform you that the commission is not involved in that project
english so i do not believe we have any means of exerting much influence now at the very last minute
english if any influence at all can still be brought to bear it would be up to the member states to do so
english human rights

english child soldiers in uganda
english madam president commissioner one could say a lot about this issue
english firstly i hope in particular that the council and the commission will be active when it comes to also taking up this issue in the security council when the action plan concerning children in armed conflicts will be debated at the end of this month
english secondly we have today noted with satisfaction that attempts are being made to reach a common solution to at least one other conflict regarding child soldiers
english this solution is the so called diamond resolution in the security council
english thirdly we can confirm that we have made a certain amount of general progress with regard to child soldiers
english we have the voluntary supplementary protocol against child soldiers and the activities in africa
english i would ask the house to support this resolution
english i would also like the eu jointly to take up the issue in the security council at the end of this month during the follow up to the general debate on children in armed conflicts
english madam president the situation in northern uganda and southern sudan is the setting for the drama of the child soldiers
english the aim of my speech and of the resolution which has just been tabled is to prompt parliament and the institutions to adopt ongoing initiatives which do more than just respond to moments of crisis
english there has been continuous armed conflict in this region for the last years civil society has been completely destroyed and different groups of rebels have been massacring the peoples of northern uganda for over years
english their favourite victims are children and adolescents because they are vulnerable and easily influenced
english to date approximately of the soldiers in the lord s resistance army are children under the age of
english the strategy is precisely to manipulate the children and subject them to brutal force so that they will in turn be able to kill and torture others
english adolescent girls are given to the rebels as wives but the most noticeable thing is that not even the nairobi agreements between uganda and the sudan last december have caused the lra to change its attitude
english during the last few days i have had the opportunity to talk to one of the girls who has escaped from the fields of southern sudan who confirmed that the lra has no intention of changing its position
english further evidence of this is the funeral of john baptista ochaia the representative of the chairman of kitgum district council who died the day before yesterday from wounds received during an lra ambush which took place today in uganda
english it is therefore unacceptable that the european authorities and many commercial entities should maintain an attitude almost of tacit approval of this situation without making any attempt to break the circle which is robbing a generation of its future
english madam president ladies and gentlemen war is always cruel and civil war even more so
english however we have reached another level of barbarism and abjectness when children are used to fight and kill or be killed
english in this way the lra the armed resistance does not hesitate to kidnap seven year old boys and subject them to extreme brutality to train them to fight and terrorise villagers
english nor does it hesitate to sexually exploit women and girls
english when these children survive it must be said they are in any case scarred for life
english it takes time patience and love to restore their hope
english this is why we must increase aid and support for unicef which has set up an action programme enabling children to return to a normal life
english madam president we must also stop pussyfooting around
english sudan must stop supporting the lra
english in my opinion this amounts to collusion which makes sudan just as guilty
english and parliament must intervene to urge the ugandan government to find a peaceful solution to this conflict in the north of uganda which let me remind you has been the cause of deaths in years
english the whole population is waiting for this solution and all the children are hoping for it
english the security council must hear this plea
english madam president i am really pleased that this resolution has come about
english i hope that this will encourage the commission and the member states to act on this issue
english some weeks ago a documentary from southern sudan was shown on swedish television
english this documentary claimed that foreign investors and oil companies including an oil company from my home country sweden are being protected by troops which make use of child soldiers
english these accusations have also been supported by amnesty international which has explained that certain oil revenues are also used to finance the civil war in southern sudan
english there they use child soldiers from uganda who are forced into armed conflict
english we must put pressure on the international oil companies and on investors
english we must as is stated in point of the resolution strongly urge these companies to cease their activities in sudan until a peaceful solution to the conflict has been found
english madam president first of all i would like to express my gratitude to mr van hecke and his wife els de temmerman for their efforts in ensuring that the child soldiers issue in northern uganda and anything related to this is published in an unambiguous manner for the benefit of europe
english what is clear is that despite the nairobi agreement it has not been possible to apply this agreement in an adequate manner
english this brings us to the question of the eu s authority and the willingness on the part of the member states to act as a united front in that region
english i would ask commissioner verheugen specifically whether he is absolutely clear about the point mentioned in the resolution that of bringing the investments in both oil and oil pipelines in sudan to a halt for the time being
english if we exert pressure to bring about peace and make sure we gain control in that northern region this could lead to very concrete steps within a foreign policy which combines the aid component the foreign component and the trade component
english such action is a matter of great priority
english at the moment we only see these figures and examples increase and at the same time we notice that we are exerting too little pressure although we have more clout there than we have made use of to date
english this brings me to the wider issue of the united nations
english the protocol was accepted in the general assembly in may
english in july a debate will be held in the security council
english this would of course be a wonderful example of a europe which does not only hold forth internally but also takes steps externally we all the european member states together are very much in favour of the eighteen years swift conclusion by signature and effective coordinated action by the different countries where matters such as education and the re integration of child soldiers are concerned
english we do a great deal financially in this respect in different countries
english we have a good reputation there
english it would be beneficial if we could act under one banner and with one voice
english i would be interested to find out from commissioner verheugen how he rates our chance of success in july
english madam president i was in uganda in january when some of the abducted little girls who were put into the army by the lra were released
english many of these young girls lose sight of their families and are gone for many years from their own homes
english as a result of rape and abuse they become mothers themselves which further alienates them from the communities from which they have been so brutally taken
english however many finely worded resolutions we have as long as we in the community fail to get to grips with the issues relating to children in our own community we do not have a strong voice to raise our concerns about this
english many of our policies affect children s rights and interests but this week commissioner prodi said he did not feel it was necessary to have a dedicated unit looking at children s rights within the community
english this will weaken our voice if we attempt to raise it within the context of the un special summit on children next year at which the issue of child soldiers will be a significant point
english situation in the moluccas
english madam president the moluccas require our attention once again
english after a relatively quiet period the recent arrival of a few thousand jihad fighters who aim to enforce the islam religion on the moluccan islands has led to renewed escalations of violence
english the peaceful coexistence of muslims and christians which lasted for years seems to be broken for good
english the brave attitude of president wahid should not go unmentioned
english last week he even dared criticise the position of the members of parliament
english if it were up to the indonesian president there would be hope for a peaceful future on the moluccas
english however the dark forces that still pervade the administrative apparatus namely within the army police and government have a very destabilising effect on the situation
english it still requires a great deal of effort to identify the fundamentalist elements of whatever religious grouping
english i would like to make a few specific recommendations to the indonesian government
english firstly there must be an all out effort to discontinue the supply of fighters and weapons by introducing strict border control
english in addition the deployment of international peacekeeping forces deserves to be reconsidered
english the stark differences of opinion within the region s own army and police seem to sabotage indonesia s efforts to end conflict off its own bat
english finally i would like to ask your attention for the victims of these conflicts namely the ordinary citizens
english in this conflict we should not only spend time pointing the finger we should first and foremost supply adequate aid to the refugees
english a humanitarian corridor is essential in this respect
english we wholeheartedly back the request to the commission and member states to give generously
english the lack of political and economic interests in that region should not determine the level of aid
english this is about relieving the real suffering that is pervading the moluccas
english madam president i wonder whether history is repeating itself in indonesia
english the bloody confrontations between muslims and christians are jeopardising safety within the moluccas
english thousands of people have been killed or have taken refuge and the new fragile democratisation process which has been initiated so ambitiously by the wahid government is under enormous threat
english this is reminiscent of east timor only a few months ago
english as an mep visiting with the observation delegation i saw for myself how harrowing the effects of this can be
english we need to realise that the violence within the moluccas is threatening stability within the entire region
english it is therefore vital that the international community offer immediate financial and moral support in order to solve the problems in indonesia
english the international community also has a duty to monitor the situation closely on a permanent basis and help the government there to end this human tragedy in whatever way it can
english madam president as rapporteur of the committee on foreign affairs human rights common security and defence policy reporting on indonesia i did hesitate for a moment before i tabled this resolution because we will certainly be having a huge debate on the relationship between the european union and indonesia in the autumn
english however the situation on the moluccas is so critical that we need to treat it as an urgent matter
english after a few months of peace and quiet in that area violence has flared up again over the past few weeks and once again dozens of people have been killed and once again thousand of people have fled
english the tragedy of the boat filled with refugees travelling from duma on halmahera has probably claimed the lives of up to five hundred people
english only yesterday the jihad fighters burnt down two housing estates in ambon
english in that area more than three thousand have now been killed and more than one hundred thousand people have fled
english this is a catastrophe and many moluccan families in the netherlands are either worried sick or plunged in deep mourning
english madam president despite this tragedy i believe we ought to pledge our support to president wahid and vice president sukarnoputri
english it is not they but the opposition powers working against this government that seem to aggravate the situation within the moluccas
english it seems that the jihad militiamen are being financed and armed by these groups and sometimes backed by regional military forces which are in fact supposed to protect the population
english in our opinion however the indonesian government should intervene more powerfully in order to protect the moluccan population
english we also believe that international observers journalists and aid workers should be granted access to the area in order to help the moluccan citizens
english but more than anything the eu should adopt a clear stance just as the united states has done and the eu should step up its aid efforts for the victims
english madam president our green colleagues have tabled a number of amendments which may have been compiled with the best of intentions but are to my mind counterproductive because they might be playing into the hands of the powers working against the government i e those who are helping to stage the violent attacks on the moluccas
english i therefore reject the amendment to article a and would ask the meps of the other groups to do the same
english more than anything however the union should be more pro active
english this is also the thrust of the resolution and i would like a sound response from the european commission
english madam president ladies and gentlemen it is becoming increasingly clear that the violence on the moluccas is not a chaotic spontaneous fight between the local population between local muslims and christians
english it is a brutal power struggle and well directed fight between sections of the army between the government and government opponents at the expense of the local population
english on the one hand there is laskar jihad a group of fanatical muslims backed by sections of the army
english on the other hand there are special police troops which back the christians
english in other words the security apparatus which should guarantee stability is divided over two camps
english in my opinion the message which the european parliament should give president wahid and in this sense i hope i can reassure mrs maij weggen is that we will remain critical of the progress and speed of reforms the status of human rights and the way in which the government protects the citizens on the moluccas
english however we must also let him know that we support him in his fight against those sections of the army which are of course trying to undermine democratic reform in his battle against people like amien rais the chairman of the people s consultative assembly who for example referred to young people devoted to the laskar jihad as the heart of the nation
english in that sense he deserves our support but i also want us to remain critical about issues which are not going so well yet in indonesia
english madam president on behalf of the socialist group i would like to endorse what mrs maij weggen stated
english it is vital to support the wahid government at present
english in plain terms and i think the european commission and the council are taking a sensible stance here this support entails tracking down specific resources in order to support that government in its attempt to pacify and to actively intervene
english this is our urgent request
english we are also very critical of the situation in that region and very concerned for the moluccan community in the netherlands we particularly empathise with the emotional turmoil and anxiety they are experiencing
english we are in favour of granting wahid support because the moment we involve international observers or commit other forms of aid without wahid s knowledge we will be intervening and undermining his actions
english in this sense i clearly endorse the ppe s stance and would strongly urge this house to show great concern and great willingness to provide support but via wahid and also prescribe requirements to be met again via him because we need to play the game through him for the time being
english madam president i think that mrs maij weggen is quite right to call the situation catastrophic
english it is in fact a complex situation in which many people have died the question that arises is why communities that had been co existing relatively peacefully should suddenly shift to this level of tension and threats
english i think that certain forces are at work behind these actions and there is a significant similarity between a certain type of behaviour that we are now seeing in the moluccas and the events we recently witnessed in east timor
english behind these actions are forces that wish to sabotage president wahid s efforts at democratisation we need to understand these forces and to combat them
english from this point of view i think that the references in the compromise motion for a resolution which deserves our total support are most timely
english death penalty in the united states
english madam president in our resolution on the death penalty which we agreed with the other groups we appealed to the governor of virginia to spare the life of a person sentenced to death
english the name of the governor of virginia has been missed off the list of recipients of the resolution
english please would you ensure that the governor of virginia s name is inserted at the end of the text of our resolution for our appeal is addressed precisely to him
english yes mr manisco you are absolutely right
english in the text of the resolution reference was made to this state
english technically speaking it would therefore be appropriate to communicate it to the governor of virginia and it will therefore be put to the vote with this amendment
english madam president we can all put our signatures to what is written in the resolution
english we know that the united nations commission for human rights requested a moratorium in april last year
english this year this demand was repeated
english they also requested all the states which still had the death penalty progressively to reduce the number of crimes for which the death penalty is imposed
english we have many shocking figures relating to the number of people that are still awaiting the death penalty in the united states
english according to the information that i have this involves people
english in the resolution we point to the prevailing legal uncertainty in the present cases
english there is therefore reason to require that all cases be investigated that is to say that the cases of those who are awaiting punishment should be gone through and for example investigations made into whether they have received fair trials
english therefore a moratorium is necessary in all cases even those that are not mentioned in the resolution
english we are also given hope by the fact that the issue of the death penalty in the united states has been given a completely new political importance
english i also value the work that the human rights organisations have done to bring this issue to the fore
english mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen mrs thors has already said this there is unanimity in this house in support of this resolution
english we must also question the actions of the european union and its ability to pursue this initiative in favour of the international moratorium alongside the united nations and the international community
english we know the difficulties encountered by our institutions mainly due to their odd nature in particular with regard to foreign policy an area under the responsibility of a commissioner a high representative and fifteen foreign ministers
english to avoid repeating last year s failure at the united nations we must urgently coordinate the actions of the european union
english to this end i have presented an amendment asking that this policy within the united nations in favour of the establishment of a universal moratorium be coordinated by the high representative for common foreign and security policy
english i therefore urge my fellow members to support these amendments
english mr president this house is appealing to the governor of virginia to spare the life of a man derek rocco barnabei sentenced to death who is in all probability innocent
english as we debate our resolution in a death cell in the same state they are sterilising the needles which will be used to administer the lethal injection which in a few hours time will kill michael clagget probably guilty of multiple murders committed many years ago
english we have adopted countless resolutions during these last two parliamentary terms in a vain attempt to put an end to the death penalty in the united states and elsewhere
english what is certain is that many other executions will be performed at an increasingly high rate before august in virginia and other states in particular texas whose governor who will almost certainly be the next president of the united states of america holds the world record of having put human beings to death in the last five years
english i do not know whether george w bush boasts of this record but i do know because he told me in a letter he sent me dated march that he is confident that he will be able to fulfil the highest obligations of a fair and errorless justice
english the resolution before parliament notes the fresh debate which is currently in progress in the united states not on the abolition of the death penalty at all but on a moratorium intended to ensure a more reliable but no less merciless system
english we may well have done the right thing but i fear as the american herald tribune said recently that these endeavours of ours are destined to remain unheeded a dead letter and so the time may well have come not for boycotts and sanctions which are abhorrent to us but for example to promote european tourism only in the dozen states of america which do not inflict the death penalty
english there would be a serious extremely serious risk of retaliation from the united states if we stay away from donald duck or disneyworld in florida the americans would boycott the mona lisa in the louvre
english the time has come for us to take this risk in a last attempt to put an end to this barbaric practice which is such an insult to the human family
english mr president the united states we recall is the country of the world which has had for the longest time an entrenched and justiciable bill of rights
english it is therefore a horrible irony that the united states is one of the few countries in the developed world which still retains and practises the use of the death penalty
english we face today a particular case that of derek rockwell barnabei each human being is an individual in her or his own right and must be stood up for as such
english we appeal for his life today but he is also a symbol of a practice which we find appalling and which we know to be going on in many parts of the united states
english i am myself a great lover of the united states and many aspects of its way of life
english i have been a frequent visitor to the law school of the university of texas and to other law schools in the united states
english i admire them very much but i am really sad to see that state and its governor practising this so frequently and boasting of it in presidential campaigns
english mr president the case of derek rocco barnabei makes our resolution all the more urgent
english in this specific case there are reasons to suspect that there has been a miscarriage of justice
english clearly where the death penalty is involved a miscarriage of justice is particularly serious let us not forget that miscarriages of justice in similar cases have subsequently been acknowledged and it was no coincidence that the defendants in these cases were people who could not afford an expensive attorney
english i believe that the high quality of the law faculties in the united states is due to the fact that the attorneys are very highly paid but they are only highly paid by those can afford to employ their services
english therefore we call for a repeal of this sentence and in consideration of the petition signed by an extremely large number of members over the last few days we call upon the presidency of parliament to write to the authorities responsible immediately insisting that they attend to the matter and of course insisting too that the death penalty is abolished in the united states so admirable a country in so many other respects
english and it is precisely these merits that make the continuation of this barbaric ritual so very shocking
english hooliganism
english mr president football is a festival
english this is the motto under which belgium and the netherlands staged euro over the past three weeks
english in sporting terms it was indeed a festival except perhaps for our italian friends
english however the festival was once again overshadowed by the behaviour of some alleged supporters
english serious riots broke out especially before and after the germany england match
english in total people ended up in hospital arrests were made and english supporters were repatriated by c aircraft
english some people including certain delegates in this house are trying to trivialise the issue
english as far as i am concerned mr president there are limits to the high social cost tied in with hooliganism
english surely a country cannot take on the appearance of a police state for days on end because of a football championship
english in belgium an average of state police troops were deployed for each match plus hundreds of local police troops
english it is high time the national governments took preventive measures in order to keep the hooligan hard core at home
english germany set a good example in this respect
english in concrete terms so called football supporters who have been arrested previously on account of involvement in football violence should be issued with a travel ban
english it is therefore not primarily a case of more or less border control but of efficient and coherent police cooperation
english let us draw the right conclusions from the events in brussels and charleroi
english there has never been a greater need for hard measures and sound cooperation in order to harness this mindless violence
english hooliganism has transcended all borders both literally and figuratively speaking
english mr president too many tragedies have taken place both inside and outside stadiums incidents which are evidence of the imbalance and social unease of individuals a culture where strength is what matters and violence prevails over reason
english the resolution reiterates parliament s concern over the spread of hooliganism and calls for preventive measures which i support
english however it is crucial that in this of all situations the difficulty of their task does not make the forces of the law lose their heads as well
english at this point i would like to protest at the behaviour of the dutch police towards some italian journalists who were filming the humiliating treatment of a group of disabled people who were being carried up the steps because there were not enough free seats for them
english the journalists were prevented from doing their job and were beaten up thrown to the ground and arrested
english the film shown this morning here in parliament contained pictures which leave no doubt as to the express intention of the police to suppress the freedom of the press
english different interpretations have been given of the event and so we call upon the dutch authorities to hold an inquiry in order to find out who was responsible and we demand that this sort of incident is never repeated
english mr president this debate is not entitled hooligans but euro and this is great
english the whole of europe managed to stage a huge festival of football where the belgian and dutch authorities were the first to back this idea and which attracted huge numbers of football supporters from europe
english everyone was terribly concerned about violence and trouble and such like
english in practice the festival turned out to be a huge success all round and this resolution rightly mentions that we should congratulate the dutch and belgian authorities on this achievement
english there is also a small group of hooligans which has been operating for a while and which clearly aims to spoil this kind of festival
english they managed to do this to a very limited extent
english and they still manage to do this at some level this costs a great deal of money is a real nuisance and we therefore endorse this resolution
english we also back the initiative from the belgian and dutch home affairs ministers which attempts to introduce travel bans for this kind of hooligan when high risk events are due to take place
english thirdly i should like to mention the italian incident
english what is clear is that meps have received information from a variety of sources about the incident at de kuip stadium in rotterdam and as a result some have the impression that the situation got out of hand in a big way and that the incident was terrible and they formed their opinions based on this information
english others who gained their information from other sources have the impression that the situation got out hand there but not to such a reprehensible extent
english as a dutchman i would have liked to see the netherlands become the european champions of course and i congratulate the french warmly on their victory what i would say though is that if some delegates here got the impression based on footage they saw that certain incidents got out of hand then i do not think and the same goes for the netherlands that we should a tar the whole of euro with the same brush and b act as if the whole festival was ruined as a result
english what we should do is recognise that something is wrong and ask for all the facts to be made known
english i am therefore very much in favour of the dutch authorities launching a thorough inquiry
english fortunately prime minister kok has assented to this and i would like to pass my final verdict on the basis of these facts
english i should right away like to express my sympathy and concern for our italian fellow meps at this stage
english this goes without saying but i do want to wait until i have all these facts at my fingertips before i pass judgement
english mr president i will start by declaring an interest because i have been a class football referee for years now and i am attached to the english fa and also by congratulating both france for winning the euro championship in such a fantastic way and alas begrudgingly germany for winning the world cup bid for
english i also want to make sure that we actually condemn hooligans in a very strong way in this house all hooligans whatever country they come from and whatever their background
english i note what mr van hecke said about the repatriation of a number of english football fans on c planes
english it was a great shame in fact that the belgian police overreacted in such a way by clearing bars of decent ordinary football loving supporters taking them with the dross that are the football hooligans
english the question is what message was sent out by the football authorities going back a number of months before the euro championship
english we had a problem with two leeds fans being murdered in a uefa cup game in istanbul against galatasaray yet no action was taken against galatasaray they were not thrown out of the uefa cup
english in denmark when galatasaray played arsenal a number of arsenal fans were arrested yet not charged with hooliganism
english then we have the inaction by the british government which chose not to impose any extra sanctions on stopping people from travelling even though they knew they might cause trouble
english so all these factors actually led to a number of people thinking well this euro championship is a soft touch
english we should be allowed to go there and we are going to go and have a good fight instead of watching the wonderful festival of football that it should have been
english this parliament and others on the outside should step back because we have a breathing space now where we can take a reasoned view of what actions we should realistically take against football hooligans and compare that with the rights of people to freely move about our continent
english mr president i would like to point out that this resolution is entitled euro not hooliganism as it might seem
english and i would add that we have a great responsibility as politicians and members of parliament towards the sporting world in particular the world of football the responsibility never to lose sight of the fact that it is a merely a game
english we must therefore be concerned when the game is unduly weighed down by either economic interests or excessively emotive behaviour neither of which must be encouraged in any way by the political world
english in my opinion we must continually remind our young people including those who are the most fervent fans those who are most emotionally involved in these events that football is a game
english i would argue that whenever there is a good match such as those we have seen during euro we have all contributed to its success
english i also understand why these are particularly difficult events for the authorities to organise i remember the heysel stadium tragedy and we can therefore congratulate ourselves on the organisation of euro
english however against this positive backcloth let us consider the rotterdam incident for it took place in the extremely serious context of the provision of access to these events for disabled people this should be carried out calmly and the disabled people made to feel welcome
english moreover we were astonished by the brutality of the police in beating up journalists who were drawing attention to an extremely serious issue regarding the provision of access and assistance for disabled people
english i would stress that we are confident that the authorities had in no way encouraged such incidents and that it was the result of seriously inappropriate behaviour on the part of the forces of the law
english i therefore urge all the members not to turn this into a national issue for i consider that the content of the joint resolution is acceptable to all and can be adopted unanimously
english thank you ladies and gentlemen
english since several of you have made repeated references to the title of the item on the agenda so that you do not waste any more time on an error i will waste some time with a clarification
english the item on the agenda as approved by the house is hooligans
english the title of the resolution may be the one which you have mentioned of course but on the agenda it appears as hooligans within the section on human rights
english i will take this opportunity to insist for the record that in castilian hooligans is an anglicism for a type of specialised usually british troublemaker
english mr president the joint resolution which we are about to put to the vote is in my opinion particularly well balanced
english notably the rotterdam incident does not alter our view of the human rights record or the quality of democracy in holland which i consider to be among the most liberal countries in the world although it was treated as serious both in terms of the shameful treatment of the disabled people and because of the violence against the journalists who were merely doing their duty
english their nationality is of little importance
english the european union through its highest expression of democracy the european parliament condemns the occurrence of such an incident within its borders
english this is the best approach to take on the matter
english any national aspects will where necessary be dealt with by the governments concerned and are nothing to do with us
english on the other hand particularly in its urgent resolutions the european union does not hold back in expressing stringent positions on the conduct of other countries or events taking place in other parts of the world where human rights are violated
english would it not lose all credibility if it did not also criticise similar events within its borders
english mr president i can be brief about the championship itself france is a fine european champion and the fear that the situation was going to get out of hand on a massive scale has at any rate been exaggerated despite a number of very regrettable incidents referred to by mr van hecke involving mainly english supporters
english after the final and the entire debate seems to focus on this part of the championship now but i suppose unfortunately this is how it is a number of incidents occurred which in my view are just not on and i am mainly referring to the rough treatment of the journalists which at times was too rough
english as i see it stressed out police and stewards clearly went beyond their remits
english but there is still a great deal of uncertainty as to what happened before this and what caused it
english what exactly happened to the disabled italian supporters
english were people informed that so many would turn up
english i am saying this as a regular visitor to de kuip stadium and i know that there is space for disabled supporters at de kuip but not for an unlimited number
english did these handicapped supporters not want to be filmed or were they not allowed to be filmed
english these kinds of questions need to be investigated and the dutch government has assented to such an investigation
english until such time until the outcome of the investigation i will refrain from passing judgement
english accordingly my group will vote against any part of the resolution in which such a judgement has been passed
english i would strongly urge the italian delegates and also the italian press but mainly the italian meps to refrain from drawing any comparison with the heysel tragedy
english it is absolutely not worth it
english in this way serious matters which need to be investigated would be called into question
english my view is something happened which is now being investigated but i would urge you to keep a sense of perspective
english mr president thank you for reminding us that in fact the title of the item on the agenda that we are examining is hooliganism
english two months ago i addressed parliament regarding the need to take action against the crimes that hooligans would undoubtedly commit during euro
english the measures taken by the belgian authorities served to limit the clearly racist xenophobic and homophobic violence of the hooligans
english it is therefore becoming imperative to consider measures to deal with the instigators of such violent crimes who are often manipulated by extremist right wing movements
english it is still too easy for hooligans to move around with complete impunity within the countries of the european union
english instant sanctions must be taken in the countries where they commit crimes
english those who are identified and on file as having committed assault must be banned from entering stadiums during major sporting events
english supporters clubs and football clubs must be made to take greater responsibility as it must be said that they sometimes fan the flames
english the campaign by the french minister for youth affairs and sport mrs marie georges buffet made them take greater responsibility and this action has borne fruit
english i therefore believe that parliament can provide a real impetus for the member states and the uefa to implement such measures immediately as the red card mr president must admittedly be applied on the pitch but must also be applied with regard to hooligans both in and outside the stadium
english mr president ladies and gentlemen needless to say all forms of violence should be denounced including the outrageous expressions of hooliganism during euro
english despite this i am still convinced that the reprehensible incidents were blown out of all proportion partly by the press and partly by politicians
english because of this we have been unable to emphasise sufficiently how extraordinarily well organised euro was indeed the standard of organisation will turn euro into an unforgettable experience for millions of people
english as representative of one of the host nations i would like to congratulate everyone who was involved on the organisational side and in the enforcement of law and order
english the success of euro has shown that small nations are capable of great things and this should not be overshadowed by the wanton behaviour of a minority
english all member states should in consultation with each other take appropriate measures
english not only was euro a superb festival of football it was also a festival of solidarity among the citizens of the european union whom it brought closer together
english mr president on monday the liberal group voted against including this item on the agenda and if i now consider the resolution i believe we were right to do so
english extending congratulations in a resolution is very civilised of course but hardly the task of this parliament
english the issue of hooligans cannot be termed urgent because this phenomenon has been around for years i believe that nevertheless parliament should look into this but not as a matter of urgency
english i would now like to say a few words on the events which unfolded in rotterdam
english naturally an investigation is necessary because the accusations are very serious
english if a television team was locked up all night then this needs to be investigated thoroughly and there had better be a very good reason as to why this was done
english this inquiry is under way
english the dutch public prosecutor is involved in this matter and so it is completely premature on the part of this parliament to pass a verdict on the incident at this stage
english in my opinion this is a long way off and it is inappropriate to pass political judgement at a time when a public prosecutor is looking into a matter
english consequently i believe that the amendments pertaining to this matter should be rejected
english we could of course come back to them once it has become clear that human rights were violated but i do think that passing such a verdict would be overstepping the mark at this stage
english mr president first of all i would like to turn to mr heaton harris who about a month ago now thought that the sporting event at charleroi would have to be cancelled there would he claimed be terrible trouble
english i would say to him very sportingly as he was once a referee that i was right to blow the whistle on him then
english secondly i believe that we should look at this matter in depth and that if as the resolution indicates we could achieve greater cooperation between the various member states during an event such as euro progress would be made
english if in future we could manage to prevent repeat offenders from attending other events and if finally as mr fode sylla indicated earlier we were able to monitor a subject such as that in order to develop new teaching on behaviour in stadiums then sport and not political concern would win through
english i will end mr president by hoping that the content and pace of my speech have been as you requested that is on a human scale
english iraq
english mr president the united nations has been emasculated by two members of the security council on the issue of sanctions on iraq
english kofi annan is a good and honourable man
english however he should resign in the knowledge that the world is utterly opposed to the disproportionate severity of these sanctions
english the eu must speak out against sanctions which amount to virtual genocide
english the alleged purpose of the sanctions is to get rid of saddam hussein
english he is still there ten years later
english in fact the real purpose of the sanctions is to control oil and provide a training ground for us and british pilots so they can ensure the survival of the military industrial complexes in both the us and britain
english on my recent visit to iraq i saw children die of respiratory infections diarrhoea leukaemia gastro enteritis and malnutrition
english we must remember that this is a country that has the second largest oil reserve in the world
english operating theatres have raw sewage dripping in and out of date equipment
english we are witnessing the slow strangulation of a wonderful nation and a wonderful people
english i am a friend of islam and i think we should stop in this european union and the european parliament demonising the arabs and demonising islam
english mr president we had originally submitted a text on the same subject and with the same purport but this text gives a far more balanced view than the text of the so called joint resolution
english i would have far preferred discussing a text which strikes more of a balance
english why is it then that this text has not been published we have withdrawn our signatures after all
english in our opinion the text we submitted originally would have formed a much better base for a discussion
english mrs maes perhaps we do not understand each other very well but if you have withdrawn your signature from the joint resolution or have not signed it the text remains alive and will be put to the vote in accordance with the rules in force
english is this also being distributed
english is it available because i have noticed that many meps have not seen this text
english yes of course
english we were not aware that there was the least problem with distribution but if you say so we will check and we will have the text distributed
english mr president iraq was at war with iran from to
english during this time the usa and eu supported iraq since we perceived iran as the real threat to the middle east
english iraq invaded kuwait on august
english this was wrong and unacceptable
english the un responded by passing resolution to impose sanctions on iraq
english the un action was justified
english the usa and britain imposed a no fly zone in april
english in iraq recognised the territorial integrity of kuwait
english from to un inspectors unscom systematically and comprehensively inspected destroyed and verified iraq s capacity to produce weapons of mass destruction
english the un representative reported to the un in that unscom s work had covered virtually everything about iraq
english in the international atomic energy agency declared that iraq no longer had a nuclear capacity
english the oil for food programme started in has been excessively bureaucratic and incompetent resulting in long delays in procuring essential medicines and food supplies
english of the usd billion worth of oil revenue over three years only usd billion has been utilised for imports and usd billion remains frozen in a bank in new york
english if the sanctions were intended to destroy iraq s military capacity then they have done the job
english if the sanctions were intended to dislodge saddam hussein this has not still been achieved after ten years
english however ten years of sanctions have caused enormous suffering and hardship for the million people of iraq
english high infant mortality decreasing life expectancy increased incidence of cancer and treatable diseases continue to devastate the social fabric of a country that once enjoyed a high standard of living
english the intellectual embargo has deprived doctors teachers and other professionals of the advances in science and technology
english i believe the european union must reassess its position in helping those suffering acute hardship
english there are six eu states germany france italy spain portugal and greece represented diplomatically in iraq today
english these diplomats share the view of the un office in iraq who red cross and other ngos that the eu can through its diplomacy achieve a breakthrough
english our parliamentarians and commission officials should go on fact finding missions to iraq to meet members of the iraqi parliament eu diplomats international agencies and ngos
english such dialogue will help to establish the facts as they are today and help identify how this deadlock can be broken so that sanctions can be lifted for non military suppliers
english i hope that this house will vote in favour of this resolution
english mr president i am convinced that any type of embargo apart from an arms embargo is a violation of human rights and ineffective in combating authoritarian regimes
english my visit to iraq made me even more intolerant of the fact that in the name of the defence of democracy and the rights of the iraqi people oppressed by saddam hussein we are killing a people and destroying a country
english this is intellectual genocide
english the head of the world aid program has said so
english we have seen the victims in the hospitals children with their mothers who look at you with staring eyes and haunt your sleep doctors who watch the agony powerless to do anything
english the oil for food programme stipulates that any imported goods must be screened by the exemption committee million dollar contracts are delayed for years for fear that the goods may have a dual use medicines spare parts medical equipment and graphite tipped pencils are all prevented from entering the country
english there are no airlines offering flights to baghdad although there are no un resolutions banning such flights either because the usa and the united kingdom have declared a no fly zone
english i call upon europe to stop vacillating and suspend the embargo with the exception of the arms embargo unilaterally reinstating civilian aircraft flights
english we must trust the iraqi people to bring about democracy in iraq
english one young girl from the iraqi opposition rabye said to me while the bombs were falling on her village you are even destroying our dream of building our own democracy ourselves
english mr president if anyone needs any kind of proof that there is something seriously wrong with the continuing sanctions against iraq we just have to look at the number of resignations of high profile people within the united nations
english we can also note the words of mary robinson who has strongly condemned what is going on in relation to the sanctions
english what is happening is that victims innocent people women and children people without any power without any kind of control whatsoever are being persecuted
english there is a war against the iraqi people on which little concern has been focused and i am glad that some people from parliament have actually visited iraq to see for themselves
english it is extremely important
english the illegal bombing by the us and britain which is not covered by any un security council resolution has no mandate whatsoever and is absolutely outrageous it should not be allowed to continue
english how we can allow illegal bombing like this to continue is just beyond credibility
english the infrastructure in iraq has been completely decimated
english again the victims here are innocent people who have no power whatsoever
english i also have to congratulate here some organisations in our communities who are doing something or are trying to raise awareness and here i would mention those voices in the wilderness who are the sanction breakers i think they are playing a major role and i would like to voice my support here for them
english we also have to look at the fact that in any kind of future measures against iraq we should focus on the enhancement of human rights and democracy and we should also look at the protection of the kurds and in the north and the shi ites in the south in terms of guaranteeing them some sort of autonomy
english we cannot lose sight of them either
english mr president on april this year following a full debate with the council and the commission we adopted a resolution that was endorsed by an overwhelming majority of this house
english in that resolution we called on the council and the commission to do their utmost to protect the life and health of the iraqi people and to put an end to its suffering
english we called for the embargo on food and medicines to be lifted because it hits the iraqi people and not saddam hussein
english we called for an immediate stop to the bombing the usa and the united kingdom is engaged on without a mandate from the un security council because again this hits and punishes not the culprits but the victims in iraq
english at the beginning of that resolution we of course confirmed and underlined the iraqi government s obligation to accept and encourage the united nations controls with a view to the destruction of abc weapons and to trace the disappeared kuwaiti citizens
english with today s debate and this new resolution we are seeking to achieve three further objectives
english first we want to address not just the council and the commission but also the united nations security council
english secondly we propose that our parliament should take the initiative in sending a fact finding mission on the ground
english thirdly we reiterate the need for the united nations the world health organisation and the red cross to ensure that the most deprived and vulnerable people in iraq can benefit from the oil for food programme
english mr president like mr andrews i speak this afternoon as one who regards himself as a friend of the arab and islamic world
english this resolution can only be supported if recital a and paragraph are regarded as being at its absolute core
english we are saying that any relaxation of sanctions must depend upon iraq respecting united nations resolutions
english in particular we must ask iraq to cooperate with the international committee of the red cross on tracing the kuwaiti citizens who disappeared as a result of the illegal iraqi occupation of kuwait
english if there is to be any eu visit to iraq it must include a visit to those families in kuwait who are still waiting to know ten years later what happened to their loved ones
english any weaker position on the part of the eu will not help the people of iraq but will condemn them to perpetual tyranny
english mr president one minute is a very short time for such a serious topic
english i say serious because we are talking about nothing less than the survival of a nation and what must be called an international attack on immigrants as it was once termed by mr chev nement a french defence minister against a nation which was trying to escape the new world order
english this attack does not bode well for the future
english this new world order an expression coined by mr bush to conceal the interests of the multinationals and in this case the large american oil companies is becoming increasingly intolerable for us
english in this respect the silence of humanitarian organisations in the face of the situation of the iraqis who are suffering and over a million of whom have already died by our doing is astonishing
english what a contrast and what hypocrisy between so called humanitarianism and this holocaust that we are collectively carrying out due to simple cowardice in the face of american power that great empire that this house in particular and europe in general are incapable of opposing on any subject as yesterday s vote on echelon showed once again
english the most serious thing and i will end here as there is undoubtedly far too much to be said here is that for once a southern country was managing to develop and the northern countries lined up behind washington have been unremitting in destroying it
english this is immensely dangerous and worrying for the new century
english mr president who could not feel sorry for the sorely tried population of iraq
english i would therefore like to think that it was this sympathy that was the driving force behind those submitting the joint resolution
english the political ramifications of their intention are however a missed opportunity
english what is more they are a complete disaster for the liberated kurdish part of ancient mesopotamia
english allow me to be more specific
english contrary to what is assumed in recitals b and c saddam hussein a latter day nebuchadnesar took it upon himself to raze this old civilisation he admired so much to the ground
english this is evident from the first and second gulf war and another five years the period during which baghdad categorically refused to cooperate in the oil for food programme which led to a completely unnecessary lengthening of human suffering
english at present the iraqi government is even allowed to export unlimited quantities of oil in order to procure humanitarian aid
english in other words what is stopping saddam from alleviating the suffering of his people
english in fact what will happen with the reserved for the kurds in the unlikely event that the sanctions are lifted
english in my view the use of the strange term x intellectual embargo x in recital d is bizarre after all the iraqi intelligentsia has for decades strained under the intellectual embargo of saddam s baath party
english the tyrant of the tigris is only interested in one type of scientist the developer of weapons of mass destruction
english it is precisely this obsession of saddam hussein s which reveals the very risky naivety of paragraph of the joint resolution because the lifting of the no fly zone in the north of iraq remember this is the international guarantee for the kurds against their arch enemy saddam will probably drive millions of kurds to take flight once again
english they know all too well what saddam s pledges are really worth
english those tabling this resolution cannot possibly have it in mind to raise this awful spectre
english hence my explicit vote against
english mr president let me say that i am shocked and horrified at the commission reply on the issue of iraq and the dismissive way in which they dealt with it
english just let me quote to the commissioner and to the commission the saying of oscar wilde that in our dealings with life destiny never closes her book
english iraq deserves better than the commission reply
english i am absolutely horrified
english i wish to express total dissatisfaction with the reply of the commission
english that is all
english if you are going to be fair mr president let me say i express total satisfaction with the reply of the commission
english perfect that is one in favour and one against
english we thank the commissioner who does not want to speak
english let us be brief and we will all move on
english the debate is closed
english the vote will take place at p m
english venezuela
english the next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions
english b by mr di pietro and mr sanchez garcia on behalf of the eldr group on venezuela
english b by mr salafranca sanchez neyra and others on behalf of the ppe de group on the reconstruction and rehabilitation of the areas affected by the catastrophic floods of december in venezuela
english b by mr wurtz and others on behalf of the gue ngl group on venezuela
english b by mrs frassoni and mr kn rr borr s on behalf of the verts ale group on the reconstruction of the areas affected by the floods in venezuela in december
english b by mr linkohr and mr menendez del valle on behalf of the pse group on the reconstruction of the areas affected by the floods in venezuela in december
english mr president today we have the opportunity to show our solidarity with the venezuelan people who last december experienced the consequences of a natural disaster which affected the coasts of the states of vargas and miranda and caused the deaths of people
english we therefore insist on the importance of approving this resolution which in summary is the logical consequence of the report of the special committee which travelled to venezuela to get to know the reality on the ground of this natural disaster and also reflects the coherence of the european union s political commitments
english i hope it will thereby be possible to finance in a significant way the programme for recovery of the areas affected and that it will be drawn up according to the models for this type of action
english furthermore we should take account for the purposes of coordination of the programmes of financial aid of the member states and the community regions
english mr president as mr sanchez garcia has just reminded us this resolution comes within the scope of the decision taken by the conference of presidents to send an ad hoc mission to venezuela to assess the tragic consequences of december s floods in that country
english this issue of venezuela is serious and urgent
english it is serious because the losses have not yet been sufficiently quantified but this tragedy has caused the deaths of more than people
english it is urgent mr president because the european parliament s mission took place last february and so far we have not been able to reach any final conclusions
english i believe this parliament is stretching the bounds of its credibility
english i would like to take advantage of the presence of the commission to ask the commissioner how it has fulfilled the mandate which it received from this parliament in the resolution adopted in january to assess the community s response to the tragedy in venezuela
english i hope the commission is capable of mobilising the necessary human resources to deal with the priorities indicated by this parliament and i am sure that if the commission as it has proposed in its preliminary draft budget for is going to be able to spend eur million in the balkans it will also be able to spend eur million in venezuela
english mr president this issue raises a problem which goes much further than the resolution on venezuela
english the problem involves the preservation of parliament s capacity to respond to this type of situation
english we have to make it very clear what we want do we want a real parliament or do we want a cardboard cut out parliament
english do we want a parliament which fully assumes its duties or do we want a parliament which simply endorses the priorities of other institutions
english do we want a parliament which does its duty or do we want a parliament which simply signs cheques relating to the commitments of other institutions
english this is the debate surrounding the budget and it was the debate surrounding the budget
english mr president i simply mean that where there is a will there is always a way and that this resolution demonstrates a decisive commitment on the part of this house to show its will to help and cooperate it aims to show that the european union wishes to cooperate with the venezuelan people and society
english mr president i am convinced that on the basis of this will we will find in this budget which consists of eur million this year and will involve a similar amount in subsequent years a way to provide for the needs of the victims of this tragedy
english mr president the three points which the confederal group of the european united left nordic green left wishes to make on the aid which the european union can and must give to venezuela as a result of the terrible flood disaster are first we should throw ourselves economically and technically into resolving the consequences suffered and not reduce this aid as the commission intends in order to fund another catastrophe this time artificial caused by us in the balkans in kosovo and in yugoslavia
english secondly we must ratify and apply the kyoto commitments in order to reduce the emission of pollutants into the atmosphere which lead to the greenhouse effect and therefore climate change and its adverse consequences
english thirdly the european union must show solidarity with venezuela and with latin america in general so that we can counteract the negative effects of the great influence of the north of the continent on the rest of it
english mr president with regard to this resolution which speaks of solidarity with the venezuelan people i wish to express my total agreement with certain ideas
english firstly i would ask that aid should reach the people and groups who are most in need of it
english as a group we are clearly not opposed to this talk of smbs and industries in general but this eagerness to talk of these sectors seems excessive while we do not talk of other more needy groups
english in particular as mr salafranca has pointed out the effectiveness of the aid measures must not suffer as a result of a lack of human resources
english secondly we denounce the fact that something so essential to our group as incorporating the people affected into the drawing up and application of aid measures has not been accepted this is necessary so that we do not find that things have been done which are not needed or not wanted
english finally last but not least we should reflect on our methods of production and our consumption of natural resources because this lies behind these catastrophes and we should not be regularly lamenting them
english mr president i do not mean to give the impression that just because there is a particular sensitivity towards latin america in this house this should prevent us from also supporting the commission s efforts regarding central and eastern europe and the reconstruction of the balkans
english what does concern us at the moment is the abandonment of that area which we have begun to notice over the last year with the new commission
english it seems as if latin america has suddenly disappeared from the map of the commission s concerns
english of course we have had good experiences with the european union s contribution to central america after the mitch disaster and we also saw a good initial reaction on the part of the commission which quickly allocated eur for emergency humanitarian aid to venezuela when the disaster mentioned by previous speakers happened
english at the moment we know that the commission has the possibility the means and the resources to provide more aid
english this type of disaster is unfortunately happening frequently and i have the impression that latin america makes good use of community aid
english we have the instruments the means the good representation and also a european presence in those areas
english we must remember for example that the european union is the main foreign investor in venezuela and that we have many cultural and social ties with those countries
english therefore i hope that the commission views this parliament s requests with the best possible will so that with the resources available and with those which can be mobilised quickly these requests can be granted and that a plan may be drawn up which is not limited to essential humanitarian aid but which will help this country which is making a great effort to rebuild itself for its own benefit and probably also for our benefit because the development of latin america probably benefits the continent of europe more than any other
english mr president more than six months have now passed since the tragic floods in venezuela
english as a member of the european parliament s ad hoc delegation i was able to witness the terrible effects of what is considered to be the worst natural disaster that has ever occurred in latin america
english it was something that you had to see with your own eyes to believe as striking as the photographs and television pictures in the media were they merely hinted at the true scale of the disaster
english we were also able to see the fantastic cooperation work that the ngos are carrying out with people affected by the floods
english this emergency humanitarian aid provided by the ngos could not have occurred without the commission s financial support and i therefore wish to praise all those who made it possible
english however the priority now must be to reconstruct the whole area affected and to stimulate economic recovery
english a new plan for the region must include the rebuilding of homes and every kind of infrastructure and the provision of incentives for small and medium sized enterprises which were completely destroyed and many of which will have to start again from scratch
english i am aware that the task of reconstruction is colossal and that is perhaps why it has been so slow
english only a few roads have been cleared
english water and electricity supplies have been restored to some extent but little more has been done and the people who have been affected are despairing of the delay
english thousands of them are still dependent on food aid to survive
english it is vital to replace the thousands of jobs destroyed by the floods
english the venezuelan government will need a great deal of support if it is to succeed in this herculean task
english with regard to the task of reconstruction which cannot be delayed the commission must offer the same level of support it provided in terms of emergency humanitarian aid for countries affected by hurricane mitch or something similar
english we therefore urge the commission to provide a significant financial contribution over the next five years
english apart from a basic obligation to show solidarity the historical ties that bind us to venezuela and the stability of democracy in that country demand this
english first let me stress that quite contrary to what has been suggested here the commission is very much aware of the political importance of latin america and that in fact it has recently taken a number of initiatives that underline its great political importance for europe
english secondly let me point out that in the case of the disaster in venezuela it is still worth considering cause and effect as well as responsibility
english and the union did in fact provide extensive aid from the start and will continue to do so in future
english this aid is directed at two things
english first it is aimed at supporting reconstruction in the federal state of vargas
english it is already becoming a little easier to identify the needs here which was not the case in the beginning
english i can understand people being impatient because progress is so slow in some areas
english but the venezuelan government has not proposed any projects to us
english that is not meant as some kind of covert criticism
english it is probably difficult for the venezuelan government to decide very quickly what the priorities should be
english so we first had to send a committee of experts to venezuela to establish the priorities for ourselves
english the results are now before us
english in a few days time we will forward a communication to the council on the measures to be supported and the funding to be provided
english the second aspect which in my view is even more important than reconstruction aid is aid for the prevention of disasters
english that means we want to play our part in defining and initiating management programmes in relation to the natural risks in the federal states of falcon miranda and jarakui
english the disaster prevention measures are very much in need of improvement as we have indeed learned from this disaster in venezuela
english i believe the best way we can help the people in the long term is for us to concentrate on that
english as for funding these two measures that is a very difficult question because it really is a problem for the commission to be constantly confronted by the council and parliament with their wishes as to what it should do and where it should help but unfortunately no one tells the commission where it is to get the money from
english after all we cannot print it ourselves as you know
english we will find a way to finance these measures too and will make realistic proposals incidentally also proposals that will take account of what the country itself can contribute in view of the sharp rise in its revenue from oil exports
english thank you very much commissioner
english the joint debate is closed
english the vote will take place at p m
english european monitoring centre on racism and xenophobia
english the next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions
english b by mr van velzen on behalf of the ppe de group on the controversy involving the european monitoring centre on racism and xenophobia
english b by mr wurtz and others on behalf of the gue ngl group on the resignation of mr pelinka the austrian representative on the management board of the european monitoring centre on racism and xenophobia
english b by mr ford and others on behalf of the pse group on the resignation of mr pelinka the austrian representative on the management board of the european monitoring centre on racism and xenophobia
english mr president i agree with mr watson the chairman of the committee on citizens freedoms and rights justice and home affairs who said in an interview that the urgency tabled by mr swoboda was the wrong course to choose and that he expected a rather more mature approach
english i agree with him because in an explanatory statement which he presented to the house mr swoboda refers to conflicts between the government in austria and the head of the monitoring centre on racism that date back quite some time
english it was the time when viktor klima an sp member was head of the austrian government and the government was sp dominated
english it is a delicate matter when a socialist from austria does this but by no means urgent
english i endorse what mr watson said because here mr swoboda is also confirming to the present government that better relations are now being established with this monitoring centre
english he should be pleased about that as i and many others are
english that again is no reason for urgency and there is even less reason for urgency when i quote you what the head of this monitoring centre says in an interview she authorised
english she specifically praises austria s new policy towards foreigners and concedes to the government that there has of course not been a single xenophobic initiative whereas there is much progress
english she says much progress which was not possible under the red green government and of course she also says that she is not being hindered in any way in her work
english so what is the point of all this mr swoboda
english as an austrian socialist you are obviously just trying to create a platform for polemics against austrian
english that is shameful for an austrian and should be condemned in the strongest possible terms
english mr president i apologise to the translators if i spoke too quickly earlier on
english i would like to talk to you about the resignation of mr pelinka from the management board of the european monitoring centre vienna
english i believe that what happened to mr pelinka a renowned academic respected by the scientific community is indicative of the true nature of the coalition in power in austria
english the far right particularly when it is in power is highly skilled in the art of pushing its opponents to the limit
english what happened in the case of mr pelinka did not come about by chance or coincidence
english it began with slander he was persecuted by means of an unfair judgement given by a court answering to the fp as the current justice minister of the fp was j rg haider s lawyer when he sued mr pelinka for libel
english the work of the monitoring centre was then made unbearable by a public pressure campaign against its members
english i believe that haider is and we must recognise this expressing his contempt for the sanctions that the european union is currently imposing on him as it was when the portuguese presidency took the initiative of proposing the nomination of three wise men that he decided to retaliate by demanding a referendum on lifting sanctions a completely demagogic populist and anti european referendum
english we are also talking about a challenge issued by haider to the community as a whole
english he reminds us that the monitoring centre is a creation of the european union and that our president attended its inauguration three months ago
english this is proof for those who might still have doubts that we must not negotiate with the far right as every small victory it achieves strengthens it and makes it more commonplace
english if the european union were to relax its position on austria this would not miraculously lead haider and his friends to defend human rights and relinquish their ideology
english in response we must give mr pelinka our total support we must also help the monitoring centre on a human political and financial level and finally the member states must continue to isolate the austrian government and while supporting the austrian people isolate the coalition which is unacceptable and unfair
english mr president i had the honour of representing the european parliament on the management committee of the european monitoring centre on racism and xenophobia and one of my colleagues there was professor doctor anton pelinka representing the austrian government
english he played an important role in our deliberations counselling moderation when others wanted to move too far and too fast resisting cheap easy stereotyping of those we were investigating and imposing fact in preference to fantasy
english all in all he was a frustrating friend for those of us who wanted to move further and faster
english i was therefore shocked to discover that state victimisation has been taking place against professor pelinka first when haider s lawyer acting as prosecutor and judge in the case of libel against mr haider whom professor pelinka described as responsible for having made national socialist positions and statements politically acceptable
english second when he was constructively dismissed from his position as vice president of the management committee of the monitoring centre through administrative harassment by sections of the current austrian government
english this resolution charges our committee on civil liberties as mr watson requested on monday to follow these developments closely
english perhaps we should not be surprised at what has happened
english mr haider said in of professor pelinka after the latter had pointed out the nazi past of hans steinecker a precursor of the freedom party the time is up for falsifiers of history and those who insult austria
english pelinka has a disturbed relationship with carinthia and his manner of permanently propagating falsehoods is unacceptable
english in march this year the freedom party said the newspapers were right once again
english now he h ider is threatening us
english but he is not threatening anybody
english it is quite normal
english when i feed a dog and it bites me then i will not feed it any more because otherwise it may bite me again
english the wise men have a hard task in front of them over the coming six months
english mr president i am deliberately refraining from entering into these cheap polemics especially on the part of mr pirker but want to keep the discussion at a certain level and stick to the facts
english it is a fact that the monitoring centre on racism and xenophobia did indeed face difficulties in the first weeks which were politically motivated and that mr pirker in particular grossly insulted the head of the centre whom he has cited today as a witness to show how well things are going
english it is a fact and i noted that in my first statement today the ladies and gentlemen who talk so big were not even there on monday that things have thank god improved because dr winkler the head of the centre has endeavoured as has the new austrian government representative to straighten it all out
english but it is also a fact that the situation remains precarious and here i like dr winkler must also state that unfortunately not just the austrian government but also some other governments do not give the monitoring centre sufficient support
english there certainly is an urgent need to call on all the governments as i propose to support the monitoring centre
english but it is also a fact that sad to say the referendum announced for austria which representatives of the european and in particular the austrian people s party who are sitting here in this chamber opposed only a few days ago could dangerously aggravate the situation and mood in austria again for it is reviving anti european feelings that will certainly not do the work of this monitoring centre any good
english and that is why i want to state my view here and call on the government on those responsible in that government not to hold that referendum so as not to stir up new hatred not to reawaken an anti european mood again something a party like the austrian people s party which was always pro european is in fact unlikely to want
english i am firmly against that kind of anti european mood and i place my hopes in this house
english mr president i will tell you immediately that the eldr group refused to sign the joint resolution for a very simple reason we find it a little over emotional while not forceful enough and does not offer the possibility of a more political and more balanced choice in the name of parliament
english it is because this resolution is too weak that we will not vote for it
english we consider that the problem associated with the resignation of mr pelinka is important enough not to be tackled by a resolution that is emotional but does not actually say anything and is extremely watered down
english allow me to address a comment to the gue group and the pse group
english i do not understand their agreement on the text in its current form in relation to the initial text that they themselves introduced
english consequently we within the liberal group would like and this is the wish of mr watson his committee to be able to effectively take control of the matter and we would like to have very clear information on whether the austrian government has infringed article of the treaty that is whether or not it has fulfilled its obligations with regard to the monitoring centre
english if it has not fulfilled its obligations it is up to parliament to take the appropriate action with regard to the commission and the council
english the main thing is to make it clear and today we are not clear
english mr president my group also supports the proposal by the chairman of the committee on citizens freedoms and rights justice and home affairs to treat this whole affair carefully in that committee
english nonetheless we will vote for this resolution because unlike the earlier ones it is an extremely moderate and responsible reaction to the statements by the head of the monitoring centre to the committee on home affairs
english the epp group also took part in the discussions and decisions on the present resolution
english so i am extremely surprised that the members of the austrian people s party are unable to endorse this resolution which merely expresses an initial concern and is an initial call on the austrian government and have chosen instead to give us a taste of the way the austrian government treats its government critics
english mr pirker reads out some statements by the head of the monitoring centre but keeps silent about the terrible statements she made in committee where mr pirker himself launched violent attacks on her about the defamation of the centre in the austrian parliament about the systematic harassment the lack of security provisions the lack of support
english i am sad to see the vp members also giving us a sample here of the way they deal with government critics in their own country in fact attempting to present them as traitors to their country
english if you listened to mr pirker s allegations that any criticism is criticism directed against austria you will see that this really is an appalling attempt to invent a conflict between the defence of human rights and patriotism
english that is a disgraceful attitude
english mr president ladies and gentlemen we are debating a motion for a resolution that is lacking in substance
english it is difficult to identify exactly what the complaints are which means we do not know precisely what we are discussing
english who has actually seen mr pelinka s letter of resignation
english who knows the real circumstances of his resignation
english what is known in austria about mr pelinka s resignation is the fact that various versions are being circulated by various people
english what i know is the fact that legal proceedings are pending between mr pelinka and mr haider under no circumstances is it the business of politics or of any parliament to go so far as to criticise proceedings before an independent court that have not yet concluded
english every state governed by the rule of law provides for constitutional legal measures
english a policy that does not respect the independence of the judiciary does not in the final analysis respect the principle of the separation of powers and thus violates a basic principle of democracy
english racism and xenophobia are a serious problem throughout the union and one that must be taken seriously
english it must be combated by every means available wherever it arises
english what i expect of the monitoring centre is to take stock of the situation objectively and to look at it in comparative terms so as to allow the policy makers to react to it
english what i do not expect of the monitoring centre is interference in day to day political matters and to exercise its mandate with an ideological bias
english because underlying the concept of racism and xenophobia there are people and their destinies and they should not be used to put on some kind of political show
english what i oppose is that this simplistic motion for a resolution is also tabled by those austrian members who pretend to support my home country
english mr president the commission is grateful for the valuable contribution professor pelinka has made as a member of the management board towards setting up the european monitoring centre on racism and xenophobia
english yet it is the commission s common practice not to express an opinion on legal proceedings concerning individuals in the member states
english that applies particularly to this case which falls outside the scope of eu legislation
english moreover the commission cannot express any views on the reasons that led professor pelinka to resign from the monitoring centre s management board
english the commission services have already requested the austrian authorities to appoint a new member of the management board
english the commission emphasises the importance of the independence of members of the management board as provided for in the regulation on setting up the centre
english i do not believe i need give you an assurance here since everyone knows that so far the commission has done all in its power to support the monitoring centre in vienna and will continue to do so in future
english we are firmly convinced that the monitoring centre plays an important role in combating racism xenophobia and anti semitism
english let me specifically underline once again that the commission attaches the greatest importance to ensuring that the monitoring centre will under all circumstances remain an independent body enjoying the utmost autonomy in the performance of its tasks
english that concludes the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance
english we shall now proceed to the vote
english before the vote on child soldiers in uganda
english mr president we agreed a joint motion for a resolution on which five groups collaborated
english once the document was finished a sixth group joined in
english i think it is contrary to our rules of procedure for a group to join in signing this motion without asking the others
english my group regards that as a breach of our rules of procedure and i would ask you mr president to examine this matter
english given that we collaborated on it we will in fact vote for this resolution yet i would ask you to ensure that the sixth group s signature is deleted from this motion for a resolution
english we have had a look at this and as far as we are aware there is no rule which stops anybody signing another resolution
english therefore the signature can stand
english but i would suggest that this be looked into for the future
english before the vote on venezuela
english mr president the same applies here as to the one i just spoke about
english i insist that you have this checked because it was just during this part session that a member of our group wanted to add his signature to a motion for a resolution by other groups but first had to obtain written authorisation from the other groups
english we cannot have two different procedures being applied in the same week
english so i would ask you to investigate this matter and inform us of the results
english for the rest we support this resolution because we helped draft it
english i fully understand what you are saying
english we will look into the matter but there does not appear to be a rule at the present time
english mr president as you say mr sakellariou at the beginning of the part session presented us with four requests for amendments to the agenda which were all rejected and now he wants to end his part session with another request which as you have already said is completely inadmissible
english we could carry on this way but we would be wasting time
english the president has already replied
english it seems to me that he is absolutely right
english i do not want any further debate
english we will look into this matter
english vote
english mr president i simply wish to express our enormous sadness at the news we have just received concerning a horrendous accident on the spanish roads in which a lorry has collided with a school bus transporting catalan school children with an initial toll of dead and injured some of whom are very seriously injured
english mr president on a point of order
english following the debates with the council last night i was wondering whether this report is actually close enough to the original proposal for first reading procedure to be possible
english there are certainly a number of amendments where we need further clarification
english if we vote for them would this actually take the report further away from what this house is allowed to vote on
english this concerns amendments nos and some of which directly imply policy down to individual schools in member states
english i would like to hear whether this is actually a legal procedure for us to be voting on now
english ll the amendments have been checked and approved by the services so we will vote on them now

english mr president i simply wish to update the information i communicated to the house a few moments ago
english the accident which has taken place in spain is really very serious
english the number of children who have died has risen to and their families to whom we wish to send our condolences are from cerdanyola del valles and from viladecans in barcelona
english i will make sure that the president is fully apprised of that and that is so done
english mr president i do not know the extent of this tragedy but if children are dead i would perhaps suggest to the house that we observe a minute s silence
english we need to have more information about the full extent of the tragedy
english explanations of vote redondo jimenez report a
english mr president i voted for the redondo report which regulates european union interventions in the event of fires and atmospheric pollution
english this is certainly a positive measure
english i voted for the motion but i would prefer it if in future in implementing the proposal we took into consideration the fact that many pensioners and elderly people live near forests and they are often the only people left in remote and countryside areas
english fires are frequent in these areas and it would therefore be a good idea or rather appropriate to use these people to help prevent fires
english pt this report contains amendments to the current regulations on the protection of community forests against atmospheric pollution and forest fires
english the amendments to the regulation on protecting forests against fires are particularly important for portugal
english in fact we must pay considerably greater attention to the mediterranean woodlands that have been affected by forest fires and this requires considerable financial resources for reforestation and for the necessary fire prevention measures
english for portugal where fires have destroyed large areas of forest it is vital to increase appropriations in order to supplement national investment in building infrastructure for example and to help local authorities private landowners associations or wasteland management bodies to buy fire prevention equipment
english this is why the increase to eur million in community appropriations proposed by the rapporteur as opposed to the eur million proposed by the commission is so important
english it is also important to create a community information system on forest fires so that the situation at any given time is more widely known this will enable us to fight more effectively against forest fires and their causes
english i shall give my own personal view of the report on forests
english i know the committee on agriculture tells us that we are having the wrong debate in defending an increase in the budget in the context of these reports
english personally i consider that we have a political responsibility to send strong political signals to the commission the council and the citizens
english in december part of the european union was hit by terrible storms which devastated a large proportion of the forests in southern and eastern france and created despair among the victims in particular small holders
english i also know that we cannot rob peter to pay paul
english by voting for the rapporteur s proposals i wanted to contribute to the implementation of a true forestry policy in the european union as despite the vast cap budget forests which are an integral part of agriculture remain the poor relation
english el forests play a huge role in maintaining fundamental ecological balances in the ecosystem of life itself
english unfortunately the protection and attention which they are afforded is not commensurate with their importance
english the major catastrophes which forests have suffered over recent years and the failure to react adequately in dealing with them are seriously jeopardising the ecological balance as well as health safety and numerous cultural and social values inextricably bound up with our forest heritage
english mountain and forest areas especially in the mediterranean have been seriously damaged by deforestation fire erosion desertification abandonment abuse and inadequate reforestation with the result that tens of thousands of acres of forest land have been lost
english allow me to bring to your attention the dramatic problem in greece which is at the top of the european league in terms of the numbers of acres burnt for every fire
english only of the surface area destroyed in greece is reforested
english the remaining is either abandoned or more usually is swallowed up and developed by economic interests such as the tourist businesses generally encouraged by the government of the day which take advantage of the fires and or are perhaps guilty of arson in starting them the unresolved problem of land ownership and the fact that there are no forest land register or records of government owned forests in order to improve their profits
english we have a wide variety of forests within the community northern temperate mediterranean and tropical and an equally wide variety of general and specific problems
english not only has the eu s forest policy to date failed as a result of fragmented one off inconsistent and incoherent action and the wholly inadequate funds provided the commission has now proposed further cuts in the already minimal funds available to protect forests from fire and atmospheric pollution
english the reason given for the proposed cuts is the reduced take up of funds during the last period
english but the problems have not been solved
english on the contrary they have multiplied
english such a policy is not merely hypocritical
english it is aiding and abetting fire
english we shall not give up
english we call on the european parliament to stand by its repeated votes and positions on the need to strengthen measures to prevent and fight fires and protect and enhance the value of our forest heritage in all areas of the union
english we believe that the community funds allocated to forests were and still are totally inadequate and we call for them to be increased in line with real needs and the importance of forests
english we really must take suitable initiatives in collaboration with national and local authorities and the agencies responsible and set out an efficient forest policy and develop direct and coordinated action so that the forests destroyed can be revived and reforested on the basis of the latest scientific data and methods taking account of the biological climatic and ecological conditions in each region and we repeat the eu and the national governments must provide the funds needed in order to create the necessary infrastructure and recruit sufficient personnel which if greece is anything to go by are woefully lacking
english in doing so we shall be helping to ensure that the forests in these countries are protected developed restored ecologically and used productively
english mr president i abstained from the vote on the arvidsson report on restrictions on the use of phthalates
english i abstained to toe the line of the group of the european people s party and european democrats but also because i was uncertain for another reason just before i came into the chamber to vote i started to wonder what would happen to the firms which produce phthalates if we ban the use of phthalates not everywhere on community territory and in all cases but only when they are used in toys
english surely they will not use these phthalates for other purposes
english for objects that might be used by pensioners or the elderly
english or for some other purpose
english i would be extremely concerned if this were the case
english i will not continue mr president because this is a public debate and i prefer to stop here
english g sv if amendment to article of the directive is adopted the following explanation of vote from parliament s group of the europe people s party and european democrats will apply
english the members of the group of the europe people s party and european democrats choose to abstain from voting on the legislative resolution because amendment to article has been adopted
english reason marking toys designed for children between and years of age and childcare articles manufactured completely or partially from soft pvc plastic containing phthalates and their packaging with a warning label is very difficult and in reality is likely to be tantamount to an indirect extended ban
english the content of the decision on labelling therefore goes beyond the scientific grounds for the directive
english fr i have a special interest in the matter of toy safety
english i was a rapporteur on this subject in and i am particularly interested in following legislative developments on the subject
english as for phthalates the chemical substances used to plasticise pvc i have always campaigned for proactive measures with a view to protecting as indeed we ought this particularly vulnerable group of consumers i e children
english experiments on animals have shown the toxic and carcinogenic nature of some phthalates which can cause liver kidney and testicular ailments in children that suck or chew on dummies rattles or teething rings
english this identification of the risks gave parents legitimate cause for concern and should have led to firm measures being adopted meeting the requirements of the precautionary principle
english the least that can be said however is that the commission s reaction albeit relatively prompt referral to the scientific committee for an opinion studies into toxicity ecotoxicity and impact on the environment the emergency ban decision and proposal to amend the directives concerned was rather lukewarm in view of the issues at stake and in view of the objective of guaranteeing a high level of consumer protection and protection of human health
english what has the european commission proposed
english it has proposed banning toys containing one of the six offending phthalates that are intended to be put into the mouths of children under the age of three and to put a warning on toys containing one of the offending phthalates and likely to be put into the mouths of children under the age of three and to revise the directive in four years time
english this is of course completely inadequate
english it is ridiculous to provide for a ban only on toys and childcare articles intended to be placed in the mouth
english as every parent knows young children put absolutely everything in their mouths
english we must therefore ban toys and objects containing phthalates which are likely to be put either totally or partially into children s mouths
english the lack of reliable scientific information on the movement of these chemical substances within the body should lead us to implement the precautionary principle
english i should also like to point out that we should be particularly vigilant with regard to the substances used as substitutes for phthalates
english it is essential furthermore to bring the labelling of toys and childcare articles containing phthalates which are likely to be put in children s mouths into general use
english to avoid encouraging children to suck or chew on their toys we should add a clause to prevent flavouring substances being added
english we should envisage revising the directive in order to bring it up to date in the light of developments in scientific knowledge
english i am convinced that given the information currently available we should adopt an approach of the utmost caution
english i supported the amendments tabled by the socialist members of the committee on the environment public health and consumer policy
english i shall conclude by pointing out that as far as the case of toy safety is concerned the regulations regarding ec markings are too ambiguous and should be clarified as soon as possible
english the threat that phthalates may pose to human health has not been proven scientifically
english for example according to research undertaken in the united states by the u s consumer product safety commission only rarely if at all among children is there a risk of exposure to harmful chemicals as the quantities of phthalates in toys do not exceed that level which could be considered harmful
english as the quantity of phthalates that might possibly get into a child s system from toys is so small the study group is not recommending that phthalates be banned
english i myself do not support the principle of excessive force and an extensive ban that is not justifiable in the light of scientific facts
english the toxic effects of phthalates are insignificant and they do not irritate the mucous membrane or the skin
english although it was found in the s that very large quantities of phthalates caused liver tumours in rats and mice official agencies in europe and the united states have not confirmed that phthalates present a risk of cancer in humans
english in addition i am sceptical about substituting phthalates with substances whose effects there is no research data on
english however i support the idea of further research into those phthalates whose effects we cannot be absolutely sure about
english in practice the problem is a minor one however as the european toy industry has in the main stopped using phthalates
english hieronymi report a
english mr president i voted for the media report but i feel that since pensioners and the elderly watch television more than anyone else and are therefore extremely interested in this european union aid it would be beneficial if they were able to watch a european television channel broadcasting european programmes
english this would make us more successful in preserving the culture of our nations which is well known in europe rather than only ever importing films from other states especially the united states of america
english i therefore hope that my proposal will be taken into account when the document is implemented
english mr president i should like to ask if the members could explain their vote in writing if reports are being discussed or at least to wait until the end if they are explaining them orally as they are entitled to do
english written explanations of votes at this time are not an expression of respect for the house for any of us
english we take note of your observation mr mastorakis
english sanders ten holte report a
english fr we abstained from the vote on this proposal even though we are firmly convinced that a policy of exchange and cooperation between different countries in the field of education would contribute to improving the quality of education by promoting the intermixing of cultures and exchanges between the peoples living in europe
english such a policy would only be a factor in progress however if it were based on an education policy within the various states which aims to earmark greater resources for public education accessible to all
english at no point in the texts though is this priority stated but more especially in none of the countries of the european union is it applied
english we are concerned that a number of phrases are indicative of a restrictive and utilitarian concept of a form of cooperation whose objectives would be dictated by the constraints of the market and initiatives by firms or private bodies looking for a workforce they could train and qualify according to their requirements
english introducing the laws of the market into education however means keeping the best quality for a minority and allowing the quality for the majority to deteriorate
english we therefore voted in favour of the amendments warning against allowing the market to play too great a part in education
english pt it is a well known fact that defining the quality of education is a very complex political issue that depends specifically on the objectives set the means to achieve them and the conditions that determine whether they can be achieved
english cooperation at european level on quality assessment and on quality indicators should not therefore generate assessment models since it is essential for us to maintain a variety of methods and approaches bearing in mind the different national contexts and varying historical social cultural and political situations in each country
english potential cooperation based on exchanges of experience in assessing the quality of primary and secondary education must therefore take account of the fact that this is a particularly sensitive area it must fully respect the responsibility of member states for the content of their education and for organising their education and training systems as well as their cultural and linguistic diversity
english mombaur report a
english mr president i voted for the motion partly because one of the recitals states that competition does not prevent the states from imposing public service obligations in the general interest on the parties involved
english i would like to hope that when this recital is implemented with regard to the provision of gas for domestic use there will be a requirement to take into account the many people who have a very low income including pensioners who do not have enough to live on and that provision will be made for the free supply of a certain quantity of gas or another type of energy
english fr overall and in each of its comments this report does nothing but extol the virtues of competition and the market economy
english its author s sole concern under the guise of unifying energy markets in europe is to deliver this entire sector into the hands of private profit
english or more exactly by separating electricity production and management of the distribution network the author is prepared to allow states to manage all the areas that require a great deal of investment and offer very little profit on condition that they hand the profitable areas over to the private sector
english unification of energy production and distribution throughout the european union and the planning and rationalisation of these activities may represent progress but only on condition that the whole sector continues to be a public service exclusively concerned with satisfying needs rather than maximising private profit
english the rapporteur s attitude is the exact opposite of this
english were the liberalisation process he advocates to come into force this would be tantamount to a step backwards
english we have therefore voted against this report
english fr as a new member of the european parliament let me say how shocked i am
english i did not take part in the previous legislature which experienced the sell off with regard to the notion of french style public service and i really do mean a wholesale sell off similar to what happened to the transport postal or even the telecommunications sectors
english in proposing to outline the situation as regards the transposition of the directive of december on electricity and of june on gas the mombaur report is patently expressing the ultraliberal philosophy of the commission which under cover of bringing about an internal energy market that is of the greatest advantage to the consumer is demanding that these markets be opened one hundred percent to competition
english the process is always the same
english the commission puts forward a minimalist directive on the basis of the argument that liberalisation can only be profitable in a context of deregulation next the supporters of ever more europe transpose the directive and go even further at the start of the year of the european market had been liberalised although the directive required only
english and finally the commission comes back a second time to regularise the de facto situation in a much more restrictive fashion
english it is all the more unacceptable given that there are still problems
english what is the point of bringing about a single energy market when electricity and gas are not compatible in terms of production and distribution development of the market or notions of public service
english how can one reasonably ask a service provider to ensure continuity of a public service which is available on a fair basis if this is not economically profitable
english by the same token how can we ask the former monopolies to now become totally competitive when they still have major investments to pay off the product of yesterday s political choices
english how can one reasonably demand ever lower prices in the sacred name of competition without challenging current requirements regarding nuclear safety
english how can the national concept of public service be replaced by the community concept of a general interest activity which is far more restrictive
english i could carry on like this at great length
english let me point out that it took decades of republican tradition to enable the gradual build up of our public services is it only going to take a transition period of four years to demolish them
english we were consequently unable to vote in favour of this report which expresses the will of the all powerful commission to go ever further and ever faster along the road of liberalisation
english liberalism may well be worthwhile but only gradually in small doses without definitively ruling out state interventionism lest we tomorrow suffer the financial consequences of giving it up
english pt in the follow up to the lisbon european summit of and march which decided to speed up liberalisation in areas such as gas electricity postal services and transport the european commissioner responsible for energy presented a set of measures seeking to speed up liberalisation in the electricity sector these included the implementation of mechanisms for cooperation in overcoming problems that might potentially stall liberalisation and negotiating access to the community market with third countries
english as you will be aware at the santa maria da feira european council the commission was asked to present a report by march on developments in the energy markets under the lisbon strategy so that we could assess progress in the liberalisation of the electricity market at the stockholm summit in march with the support of various governments mechanisms were strengthened during the portuguese presidency with the aim of speeding up the process that was already underway with the december electricity directive
english this directive stipulated the gradual opening up of this market by whereas the natural gas directive stipulates that the final phase of the opening up of this sector should be completed in this has serious consequences for portugal and specifically for the state electricity corporation its employees and for portuguese consumers
english this action sidelines both the issue of employees jobs in this sector and the interests of individual member states including the protection of a high quality public service that serves the interests of consumers we should therefore totally oppose this report
english el the purpose of this report is to justify liberalising the energy markets mainly the electricity but also the natural gas market
english basically this means taking this strategically important industry away from the public sector and giving it to private sector companies to run so that they can increase their profits
english the state then merely regulates the private monopolies and ensures that guidelines issued by the european union are complied with and it is the country s economy and its people that pay the price
english the whole thrust of the report is geared away from serving the interests of the people the interests of the man in the street and growth in the national economy and towards serving the interests of large monopolies
english the report contains quite a few inaccuracies in its bid to present the liberalisation of the energy market in an attractive light
english for example it is not true that competition has reduced prices and created jobs in great britain
english in the years since electricity was privatised prices have increased substantially jobs have been lost and there is no longer a national long term electricity development programme
english elsewhere the same report admits that jobs have been lost as a result of liberalisation but considers that new jobs will be created in non productive sectors on the stock exchange in advertising in financial services and so forth
english according to a study by the public power corporation in greece the present staff of will be cut to and numerous services which are crucial to both the ppc and the economy of greece such as the production of new technologies power station studies etc will be abolished as a result of the liberalisation of the electricity market
english privatisation and liberalisation will push up prices especially to consumers on the small aegean islands who pay a price per kilowatt hour several times below cost
english it is also unacceptable that a public sector corporation should be forced to allow private sector companies to use its highly valuable transmission and distribution grid in the name of so called competition
english if the eu really wanted healthy competition as it itself understands the term it would force the private sector to create its own grid and generating stations and compete with public corporations rather than force the public corporations to offer their grid to their competitors
english this is simply a way of making it easier to shift assets to large companies
english it is for precisely this reason that an attempt is being made to separate sectors thereby preventing public sector corporations from operating with a view to optimising vertically integrated activities and become competitive
english generating electricity is not the same as producing a simple commodity
english the energy sector is crucial to the economic development of a country and vital to its defence
english consequently liberalising the energy markets jeopardises both the security of a country and its economic growth
english this risk can clearly be discerned as the report stresses in a frontier free europe public utilities must operate in the single market
english these firms are no longer strictly national nor are their shareholders
english the gue ngl meps have therefore voted against mr mombaur s report
english it is gratifying that the efforts to create a liberalised energy sector now look seriously as if they are to bear fruit
english most countries are by now well under way with implementing extensive changes to the structures of their markets
english some countries have already implemented full liberalisation and i am especially pleased that denmark is in the vanguard
english denmark ought to make use of this favourable position and complete the liberalisation as has already happened in sweden for example
english it is therefore unfortunate that the danish government does not apparently have any plans for the time being to take the final step towards full liberalisation
english mr mombauer s excellent report hits home regarding several points
english in particular it should be emphasised how important it is to take account right now of the candidate states situation
english liberalisation of the energy markets in the countries of eastern europe will require special arrangements and particular account must be taken of the environment
english it is also important to draw attention to the fact that all electricity production should be transparent and that special support for this must in no circumstances constitute a distortion of competition
english radwan report a
english mr president the annual report of the european central bank is not terribly forthcoming on the subject of the main question that all observers are asking why has the euro which was presented as a strong currency turned out in the end to be a weak currency
english out of nigh on two hundred pages the bank devotes just a single page to this subject plus a tiny graph showing only the observed decline in the strength of the euro
english the only explanation given is the difference in economic health and structures between europe and the united states
english although that is true it is not a sufficient reason
english it should be mentioned first of all that europe is not a single country with one people one state and one economic government and that consequently the euro is generally considered to be more vulnerable than a national currency
english furthermore it was launched at too high a level at the outset precisely because it was evaluated in relation to the existing rates for genuine national currencies even though it has none of their intrinsic qualities
english how do european leaders intend to combat this depreciation
english firstly indirectly by means of policies to promote growth an approach we can only endorse
english at the same time however we see the european central bank raising interest rates officially in order to combat a non existent risk of inflation but in reality in order to support the parity of the euro
english it is a double edged sword because if it is used at the wrong moment in the cycle it may cancel out the growth that they are trying to stimulate by other means
english the other dubious solution is the headlong rush to strengthen the eleven members of the euro zone which is supposed to lead gradually to a single european economic government
english this will not change a great deal in the short term
english in order to deal with the root of the matter we should have to deny the nations of europe any autonomy whatsoever but this is patently impossible
english in any event a deadlock is being imposed on the system at the same time
english as i explained at a recent symposium of the french national assembly the charter of fundamental rights is intended to serve among other things to put an even greater stranglehold on the peoples of europe in relation to community law and hence also in relation to the single currency
english this venture is helping to take us to a point where we lose our freedoms
english mr president surely you agree that these are not explanations of vote but simply a continuation of the debate
english i still do not know how mr berthu voted not that i am interested but this is not an explanation of vote this is just a continuation of the debate
english i voted for the radwan report despite the fact that point on page calls upon member states to speed up the structural reforms of the social insurance systems in wording which does not convince me
english is it the usual request which with these words so often disguises the request to cut down on citizens pensions in order to reduce the budgetary expenditure of national governments
english if this is the aim of the report i would stress that it should rather be interpreted as rationalisation to avoid wastage in social security benefits for if they were administered more efficiently it would not be necessary to continually cut benefits and the pensions of the elderly throughout europe
english the report we are now considering attempts to defend the monetarist policies of the european central bank particularly on price stability whilst forgetting that we do not currently have a continually falling interest rate on the contrary we are in a phase of constant increases which have very serious repercussions on the incomes of less well off families who use bank loans to buy their own homes which is what happens in portugal
english the rapporteur who is delighted with the conduct of the ecb considers that what is crucial is strict observation of the nominal convergence criteria in the stability pact for applicant countries too together with the policies linked with these criteria these policies include wage moderation the flexibility of the labour market and of social security systems and speeding up the liberalisation of the services and capital sectors
english the rapporteur even goes so far as to criticise euro area countries that have reduced working hours since as he sees it this attitude contributes to x rendering labour markets more rigid instead of more flexible x
english the rapporteur therefore puts himself in the position of defending the most refined form of capitalist neo liberalism at which we must protest most vehemently by voting against the report
english karas report a
english mr president we are discussing the european parliament report on the information strategy to be adopted in the final phase of application of monetary union i would like to make it clear to mrs peijs that i voted against this report
english this report reflects the concern felt by many leaders in the face of the public s virtually total lack of interest in the implementation of the euro
english we are however eighteen months away from a crucial deadline the withdrawal of national currencies and the start of the physical circulation of euro notes and coins
english so far admittedly progress has been relatively smooth for the euro as the initial phase has principally involved technical experts bankers investment experts and stock market traders who have all had adequate warning and who moreover are favourable to the idea on the whole
english in such circumstances it is not surprising that the euro has been easy to establish in this phase
english from now on however progress promises to be a lot less smooth since the euro is about to come up against the citizens who more often than not have not yet fully understood what is going to be expected of them and who are going to find themselves cornered by decisions which have already been taken
english in order to make up for this omission the european parliament is demanding that the information policy be stepped up increasing appropriations by approximately to eur million per annum
english in order to deal with the complexes of decision makers who might be experiencing doubts it adds somewhat ingenuously that to quote the resolution voted on x according to article b of the interinstitutional agreement of may information policy is an autonomous action which needs no legal basis x
english in such circumstances indeed why should we hold back
english let me mention incidentally that we have always challenged the commission s option to make expenditure commitments without a legal basis and we also challenged this interinstitutional agreement which the council was weak enough to accept in contravention of the customary principles of proper management of public monies
english mr president i will endeavour to comply with mrs peijs wishes and keep my speech short i will simply say that i voted for this report in the hope that on december all the pensioners will be presented with a calculator which will convert their own currency into euro
english mr president i am one of those meps who has tabled amendment with the request that the commission s euro information campaign be restricted to those countries that are part of the area in which the currency is at present being used
english this means that sweden denmark and the united kingdom should remain outside the campaign while the krona and the pound are still the currencies of those countries
english it is a reasonable request that the eu not carry out tax funded campaigns in member states on sensitive internal political issues
english in the end it is a question of tolerance for one another and of respect for each nation s democratic process
english da the danish social democrats have today voted in favour of mr karas s communication strategy for implementing emu
english introduction of the new common notes and coins will have considerable practical significance for individuals and companies not only because the coins and notes are new but also because the new prices have to be got used to once the present ones have been converted into the common currency
english money is something in which it is necessary to have confidence
english it is therefore important that the necessary information should be made available and more information should of course be made available than we receive whenever countries at present introduce new designs on notes and coins
english in our vote we attached importance to information being provided in the individual countries by the member states and to special agreements being entered into with the member states concerning this issue
english we agree that it is right for the danish government not to have entered into such an agreement we look forward to a situation in which denmark too can enter into such an agreement once the danish people have hopefully said yes to the common currency in the referendum on september
english nl my party the socialist party in the netherlands has never been in favour of rushing through a common currency within the eu
english the euro is preventing us from regulating the economy by adjusting interest rates and exchange rates
english furthermore the so called stability of the euro is financed by large cuts in unemployment benefits and in provisions for education health care housing and public transport
english i am therefore of the opinion that the euro is only convenient for businesspeople lavish holidaymakers and meps but not for the majority of people
english insofar as there was ever faith in the euro this faith has been eroded extensively since the euro has dropped in value compared to the danish kroner the swedish kronor the british pound and the currency of many countries outside the european union
english i can therefore imagine that those pro euro now feel the need for a propaganda campaign
english the karas report mainly intends to instil more confidence in the euro among the public at large by inter alia involving sports associations and education
english in addition it intends to denounce the practices of swindlers and those increasing prices who are cashing in on the introduction of the euro
english i wholeheartedly endorse this part of the report but i was unable to assent to the proposal as a whole
english i reject the karas report in its entirety
english while the aim of familiarising europeans with their future currency is a perfectly legitimate one given that the decision to give up national currencies has already been taken in conditions which i deplore i am adamant in rejecting the propaganda this text puts forward in support of what mr karas terms x an essential identity building factor in the process of european integration x
english this text at least has the merit of exposing the outrageous untruth to which the supporters of a federal europe resorted when they asked the french to ratify the maastricht treaty in at that time the single currency was presented as a purely technical instrument to improve the operation of the economy in relation to the dollar and the yen and as an operation that was perfectly neutral in terms of national sovereignty
english how far we were then from seeing it as the key element in the process of integration
english this text will be an essential weapon let us have no doubt for all the people in great britain sweden and denmark fighting to safeguard their national democracies the euro even though its supporters in these countries deny it today is in fact the instrument of warfare of a federal europe rejected by the overwhelming majority of its peoples
english so when the honourable members reject the amendment tabled by william abitbol simply asking that this integrationist objective be clearly stated in the commission s communication programmes they are contributing to a propaganda operation which their voters will most certainly punish them for
english the resolution of the karas report claims that women for some reason do not share the general enthusiasm which should have greeted the implementation of the euro
english this smacks of the unpleasant tones of revolutionary propagandists of every age seeing reactionary plots between the cloth and the women in every household rejecting the bright revolutionary future
english it seems not to have occurred to anyone that it is perhaps because of their day to day experience of economics that women are more than reluctant about the transition to the euro
english this is a despicable attitude which reveals the dictatorship of the orthodox thinking which involves branding the men or women that oppose the euro or who merely show some reluctance as ignorant illiterate or uneducated
english this is where blind federalism takes us
english lambert report a
english fr the annual reports from the ombudsman and the committee on petitions belong to the traditions of this house
english parliament in turn responds to the reports from both these bodies with two reports of its own that do not vary greatly from year to year
english there is a new feature however this year the thors report supported in particular by the work of the committee on constitutional affairs and mr s derman s request is attempting to give the ombudsman a general right of access to all the documents that need to be consulted when investigating the case for a complaint
english we are opposed to this proposal not because we reject supervision of the administration but because such powers exceed the jurisdiction of an ombudsman and approximate to those of a judge
english it is obvious and we will certainly not deny it that the frenzied community administration and the ravages it causes cannot but add to the dissatisfaction of our fellow citizens and hence give rise to ever more appeals
english the proliferation of competencies the diversification of spheres of intervention and the legislative bulimia of the commission and the european parliament will no doubt do nothing to make this phenomenon any better
english the ombudsman and his colleagues are not however the right people to meet these challenges
english it is our political responsibility to cut such disputes off at source by giving our work precedence over issuing activist texts to justify our existence with proper respect for the principle of subsidiarity which will prevent the european union ruling on subjects that are none of its concern and by ourselves if necessary making use of the authority we have in terms of supervising community bodies
english too often we have seen this house hiding behind expert committees because it refused to accept its own political responsibilities
english if we have to allow the ombudsman to monitor administrative problems we must for our part learn how before and after the fact to control the insane community machinery which is running amok
english the excesses we must fight are often the product of the very nature of the current construction of europe something we must tackle at the very root
english atkins report a
english mr president do not tell mrs peijs that i am not doing my best to comply with her wishes
english i voted for the atkins report because it is extremely important for pensioners who do not have much time left to arrive at their destination on time when they travel by air as they are always short of time
english this part session has produced a rich crop of reports on transport
english i must unfortunately observe however that this sector is examined only from the liberal point of view
english mr atkins s report on the european commission proposal on the single european sky goes along with this rationale of liberalisation at any price
english this was the cause of the french air traffic controllers strike last week
english this was how they expressed their concerns about a purely commercial view of their profession
english i understand their action and i can certainly not say as much for mr atkins whose report urges the commission to encourage member state governments that currently tolerate a situation where national labour disputes disrupt air traffic to tackle the problem as a matter of urgency x
english it is pathetic
english no one can deny that the air traffic situation has deteriorated
english air traffic corridors and airports are at saturation point delays are common with one in three aircraft behind schedule and the whole business is accompanied by a trail of environmental and noise pollution
english i wish therefore to pay tribute to the determination of mrs de palacio the commissioner responsible for transport in tackling the problem head on in order to achieve the creation of a single european sky as soon as possible
english i disagree entirely however with the means she puts forward and with the report s proposals
english the report proposes to introduce competition among air traffic control centres taking away the link between regulatory authorities and operators
english the supervisory function would be carried out within separate companies whose capital would be open to air companies or private partners
english such liberalisation would serve to jeopardise air transport safety and this of course is unacceptable and contradictory to the ec treaty according to which improvement of transport safety is one of the chief objectives of common transport policy
english france would certainly seem to be the odd man out in europe where in most countries air traffic control is administered by agencies under state supervision but open to private capital
english france wishes to keep these activities in the public sector
english the principle of subsidiarity must be applied here and each member state must retain control of the organisation of air traffic control
english this is essential especially as the problem with delays is not caused by air traffic control which is responsible for less than of all delays
english in conclusion i support the proposals to strengthen the role of eurocontrol the pan european agency responsible for the management of the airspace of european states be they members of the european union or not in its capacity as regulatory authority
english the report is wrong to underestimate this agency s potential but i have voted against a report which is completely unacceptable
english fr i voted against mr atkins report because it is totally at odds with the real world and is in keeping with an a priori ideological vision rather than with any concern to meet the real needs of our fellow citizens and air transport users
english we cannot of course deny that there is a need to improve the situation of regulation and air traffic control in europe in the spirit of the single european sky
english it is perfectly obvious that the aircraft in our airspace should not be on the receiving end of inconsistent uncoordinated and complicated handling of their flight plans
english and it is true that although some progress has been made with eurocontrol the time has already come to move on to the next phase and to improve the system bearing in mind one absolute imperative safety regulation and air traffic control must not be subject to the law of competition but rather to the concept of a general interest service
english moreover the united states have never liberalised their own air traffic control as this is managed by a single state agency
english that just goes to show
english the atkins report however is entirely concerned with the goal of opening the service up to competition even though it is hard to see exactly how it could be a source of private profit or how the profits made could possibly reflect its performance
english the pretext for driving forward this liberalisation furthermore is delays in flights
english this is certainly a situation that must be remedied but in order to be effective we should really analyse the actual reasons for delays and the real solutions
english we should first of all note that there have been positive developments this year as delays have substantially reduced in france
english this indicates in the first place that we should make a distinction between temporary disruption use of airspace by the military for kosovo the change in the control system etc
english and structural problems
english we must also measure the problems due to the air companies or the limited european civil airspace with regard to the number of overflights
english air traffic control does not play a very significant part in causing delays in the final analysis and in any case improvement of the system involves improving the organisation of the coordination of the various member state control systems supporting eurocontrol in this role
english this should be the priority and the guidelines on the single european sky
english unfortunately the commission does not appear to be on this track and the atkins report is even further off the mark
english nl the aviation sector has traditionally been organised in a particularly liberal manner
english the reason for this is that governments compete with each other by building ever more and ever larger airports and that apart from these airports there is no need for creating infrastructure comparable to railways or motorways
english as such since time immemorial it has been common practice in this sector for different companies to compete with each other for the same route
english airfares bear out this freedom too
english there is no link whatsoever between the distance to be covered and the fare
english where passengers are wanted prices are low where it is believed that there are more than enough passengers prices are high
english there is little left to be liberalised in this sector
english despite this there are people who expect further liberalisation to be a panacea
english it is supposed to lead to cheaper flights a wider range of flights and no more delays
english according to the confederal group of the european united left nordic green left this consideration is very one sided and only serves two interests that of airline companies and that of the consumer whose only focus is more and ever cheaper flights
english in our opinion a number of other aspects take priority over this such as passenger safety livelihoods and the working environment of the employees environmental protection and the protection of the railway industry from price dumping and other forms of unfair competition
english there is little point in blaming the workers for everything that could cause irritation among passengers these workers are sometimes obliged to strike out of self preservation
english neither is this the fault of eurocontrol which has taken over a number of cross border state responsibilities
english safety should not come second to the pursuit of profit by companies which aim to take over eurocontrol s market
english the problem has far more to do with the excessive growth in aviation and price competition at the expense of long distance rail transport
english the current proposals do not address this problem
english from this critical stance we tabled amendments
english since it has transpired that a majority within parliament does not support our stance on this we were unable to assent to the final version of the atkins report
english pt although this report deals with certain real situations such as the increase in air traffic or the delays experienced on various routes and although it is based on certain correct premises specifically the need to guarantee and strengthen air transport safety it nevertheless glosses over the underlying causes of these situations which are inextricably linked with successive actions to liberalise air transport and with the unbridled competition that has resulted from this
english in particular it draws hasty and mistaken conclusions which lean markedly towards the liberalisation of airspace and towards the future control of this airspace by the main air transport companies
english since it is true that effective cooperation is required and since technical and disciplinary measures are essential in this area we do not support these guidelines which are even more radically in favour of liberalisation than those suggested by the commission
english if these guidelines were followed they would exacerbate safety problems and would lead to greater social problems in addition to raising questions about the sovereignty of each state over its air space these questions are all the more relevant because this air space is shared by their respective military air forces
english fr on june french air traffic controllers went on strike to protest against the plans of the european union to liberalise air traffic control i should like to show my solidarity with this strike and with the demands of the air traffic controllers unions
english the responses to the saturation of european airspace are pushing us into a headlong rush with airports and airstrips proliferating the working conditions of employees in the sector deteriorating and pollution on the increase
english we on the other hand are in favour of the harmonised development of transport on a european level prioritising the fulfilment of real social needs and opting for railways as the best solution for most needs particularly for distances of less than kilometres
english liberalising air traffic control will not solve the problem of delays since only to of delays can be attributable to air traffic control
english it is known that today the military have seized in france for example of the available airspace
english why has this never been challenged
english the commission is using the delays as an excuse to move towards a split between a european regulatory office and the establishment of a privatised internal market for the provision of air traffic services
english such measures undertaken under pressure from lobbying by air companies can be implemented only to the detriment of safety especially given that the companies themselves will be able to put themselves forward to provide such services
english it is for all these reasons that i voted against this report
english dami o report a
english i voted for the dami o report mr president partly because i voted for the amendment which stipulated that women on maternity leave should receive a full allowance
english maternity is not an illness
english this morning the italian newspapers contained the news that medical treatment for dogs and cats will be tax deductible
english if there is enough money to spend on dogs and cats there ought to be enough for women on maternity leave who are not ill but people who have the right to a full allowance
english mr president this report on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the health and safety at work of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding is very valid and is a step in the right direction
english point in particular contains many positive proposals
english at the same time i would like to warn against a development whereby we in the european parliament end up devoting ourselves to social policies and social legislation something which i think is on all accounts the duty of the member states
english it is a very important part of the cultural and social identity which every nation and every country creates
english this is one of the most important questions of all in every election campaign in sweden and in other countries
english let this remain a national issue
english mr president the pregnant mother and her unborn child mothers who have recently given birth and breastfeeding mothers need as much support as possible during this very important period which is important not only to the individual mother and child but also to society remembering the low birth rate and ageing population in europe today
english certainly companies have social responsibilities but surely governments should set an example especially in those countries like my own where the role of mother and the family is protected in the constitution
english unfortunately this does not appear to be the case in ireland regarding paid maternity leave facilities for breastfeeding and exemption from night shifts
english i give these examples to highlight the fact that just because a directive has been agreed it does not mean it has been implemented
english it is high time we stopped paying lip service to working mothers their children and their families in our european community
english fr in this report we voted in favour of the paragraphs which contributed towards protecting the working women both in terms of their health and wages and in terms of children s health
english it is however to be deplored that the report does not even propose to bring the advantages and rights into line with the countries where these are most favourable to pregnant women in work
english moreover we should not like our vote in favour of the specific protection of women night workers during pregnancy to be interpreted as legitimising women s working night shifts
english quite the contrary we wish to restate our opposition to night work if it is not socially useful not just for women but also for men
english the prohibition of night work for women is a right acquired by the working movement in france
english to revoke this would be a retrograde step in social terms
english to speak of equality between men and women is hypocrisy
english this hypocrisy is intended to conceal the fact that the legislator is more concerned to reassure employers that their factories may be operated profitably than to guarantee the health and safety of employees
english i abstained on amendment no submitted in the name of mr bushill matthews which called for the special needs of smes to be recognised when implementing health and safety legislation
english i have every sympathy with this desire but the amendment is superfluous as article of the treaty clearly states that directives in the social field including health and safety shall avoid imposing administrative financial and legal constraints in a way which would hold back the creation and development of smes
english i believe therefore that the sentiments expressed in the amendment are already covered and it is unnecessary to repeat this in the report
english el here we stand once again under a shower of good intentions which even if translated into a set of positive proposals are doomed to remain dead letter because they get nowhere near the nub of the problem and do not touch on the main trend causing the problem
english the european parliament s proposal contains numerous positive proposals which are negated by its very inability to set out the problem of negative developments in labour and labour relations as a whole
english because no attention is given to the main trend towards restructuring labour relations and reducing and abolishing the fundamental rights acquired by workers or framework labour conditions such as minimal working times and conditions temporary and part time employment and cuts in social security and protection the resultant framework is completely negative and non conducive to the application of any policy to protect working women during and after pregnancy
english we wish to point out and highlight the risks inherent in a strict prohibition on dismissal especially under the present extended regime of generalised atypical employment contracts and the indirect exclusion of pregnant women from jobs a regime in which we need not just to maintain and consolidate but to increase maternity leave define the maternity allowance more clearly and apply strict and more substantive controls on night work by pregnant and breastfeeding working women
english not only must we strengthen the legal framework protecting the health and safety of pregnant women and rectify omissions and clarify ambiguities the trojan horses used to bypass and infringe legislation we also need to deal with the lack of political will on the part of national governments to apply the directive properly a lack which is sorely in evidence from the sluggish state of control mechanisms in the member states during the previous period
english a typical example is greece where there are no controls on employers obligation to carry out an integrated written assessment of occupational hazards in the workplace including a specific assessment of the hazards to pregnant and breastfeeding women
english experience has demonstrated that reducing employability and adaptability to guideline community priorities on employment issues renders any protection basically non existent and cancels any individual arrangements in practice
english the problem is what guidelines are being issued what sort of employment policy is being applied
english and unfortunately we have confirmation that the eu wants to make more drastic cuts to allowances and social insurance to amend and downgrade provisions on dismissal and to reduce and abolish provisions to protect working conditions
english we must not delude ourselves as to the nature of employment policy and the social policy of the eu in general or the interests which it represents which is why despite sharing the eu s positive position on the protection of working women we believe this is nothing more than yet another report of ideas and good intentions
english we therefore call on working women and men to continue their social fight for an overall change of policy and for a policy which centres on man and respect for his needs and dignity
english a fight geared primarily to the implementation of the principle of full and stable employment with full consolidated social rights for everyone
english only such a framework will safeguard the rights of the particularly sensitive category of pregnant women and the rights and respect for life as something other than the raw material of profit subject to the laws of costs competition and inexorable market forces
english fr we are in favour of all the amendments to the directive seeking to improve the protection of pregnant employees before during and after their maternity leave
english the resolution proposes to remedy some of the omissions in the present directive and to harmonise european legislative systems to align them with those that guarantee the most rights
english we endorse such proposals in the name of guaranteeing employees rights to health especially as the proposed amendment of the ilo maternity protection convention convention reveals many retrograde steps such as the exclusion of certain categories of women from entitlement to maternity leave the minimum duration of maternity leave and the possibility of making a woman redundant during this leave
english a strict european framework must be established to protect pregnant women against any form of discrimination during recruitment regarding issues of their working conditions access to maternity leave or its duration weeks including mandatory weeks after the birth
english women must be protected against any wrongful dismissal and their former wage must be guaranteed
english finally night work must be prohibited for both men and women in sectors where it is not absolutely essential rather than seeking to modify the conditions for pregnant women
english short sea shipping
english the next item is the report a by mr peijs on behalf of the committee on regional policy transport and tourism on the commission communication to the council the european parliament the economic and social committee and the committee of the regions on the development of short sea shipping in europe a dynamic alternative in a sustainable transport chain second two yearly progress report
english the rapporteur mrs peijs has the floor
english mr president in the commission submitted the communication on the development of short sea shipping on the basis of the strategy which was formulated in the white paper on the common transport policy
english the second annual progress report on this draft is now before us
english however after five years it has become clear that short shipping is still merely an empty promise which has not been kept despite the verbal support by the transport council of december which considered short sea shipping as a priority
english we are not trying to boost the popularity of short sea shipping out of idealistic motives
english it is a fact that transport shipping will increase by in the next decade
english it is impossible to meet this growing demand by road transport alone
english short sea shipping is therefore not a competitor of road transport the train or transport using inland waterways it is one of the modes in the transport chain
english it is in everyone s interest to keep the irritation communities are caused by the constant drone of through freight transport to a minimum
english transport should also be as clean as possible and in that respect too short sea shipping meets high requirements
english speed might not be the main feature of short sea shipping safety is
english weekend traffic bans and traffic jams are a curse to road transport
english in many cases short sea shipping can provide a solution to these problems if it is used in combination with other modes of transport
english at the same time i do not want to claim here that it is a panacea
english we will take the pressure off quite substantially if we try to make the best use of all modes of transport and combine them in the best way we can
english but in order to do this a number of conditions do need to be met
english in its communication the commission makes a distinct reference to industry itself
english this is fine but as rapporteur i would like to add another dimension
english there are some very specific aspects where mainly governments at national local or regional level can add weight and can give short sea shipping a boost
english in its communication the european commission provided a sound overview of the issue as a whole
english parliament and your rapporteur have looked at the commission plans with a critical eye and tried in consultation with all parties involved as befits a parliament to compile this report
english industry was asked to raise practical issues which could in their view obstruct the development of short sea shipping
english we are still awaiting this report
english i would like to underline a few aspects
english once again short sea shipping can only take off in europe if it is considered an integral part of the transport chain
english connections with the hinterland in the form of rail internal waterways and road are essential in this respect
english as such it is important that short shipping is integrated with other modes of transport and this means that infrastructure will need to meet certain requirements
english short sea shipping is also eminently suited to specialist transport cars are a good example of this
english innovation in the construction of specialist ships will prove decisive here and this could give our shipbuilding industry a shot in the arm
english the sector s image is also important and must clearly be cleaned up
english the sector is suffering from excessive red tape
english procedures last forever
english but increasingly we can also point to many positive developments within the sector
english industry should take its responsibility there for example in the setting up of regional promotion and marketing agencies but the market cannot do this on its own
english member states must lift obstructions
english for example the road transport monopoly springs to mind with the impact this has on the levels at which short sea shipping should pitch its prices to tie in with bilbao s short sea port
english at every level excessive bureaucratic procedures and endless red tape accompany the cargo
english this puts short sea shipping at a disadvantage compared to other modes of transport
english accordingly parliament calls for this sector to be treated with the necessary flexibility thus enabling this sector to acquire a better position in terms of affordability
english for example we have in mind the introduction of exemptions from pilot service in ports where captains can demonstrate they have a high level of experience
english by the way an irritating error has crept in to the erratum where the experience of the pilot is referred to
english this should of course be the captain otherwise this is complete nonsense
english the market is still fragmented at present
english this is why in its report parliament points to the need for a one stop shop approach to offering logistical transport services to end users these services should embrace all multi modal transport services and should in this way counteract the fragmentation of the present services
english in my report i also call for incentives from the commission which are needed to promote short shipping
english in view of the european connections i would also ask for investment projects in mainly the mediterranean sea area and the ports along the adriatic sea
english short sea shipping requires destinations
english you may have wonderful short sea terminals in rotterdam but you need to have a destination
english the setting up of these new lines requires critical mass and it could be one or two years before these resources are available
english the european union will need to help out by providing cheap loans from the european investment bank in order to overcome this difficulty
english furthermore we are lacking information and statistical data on which industry can base its investments
english no one knows what we transport in what way where to and in what quantities
english i believe that statistical data on what we transport where is one of the things we need as a matter of urgency in order to pursue a policy for transport which will grow at an amazing rate in the next couple of years
english mr president on behalf of my colleagues ripoll and perez alvarez who have worked on this report but who are not able to be here i would like to congratulate the rapporteur mrs peijs on her marvellous report in particular because it deals with a problem which is important for very real and practical reasons
english furthermore i wish to say that there are two things which i am regretting right now firstly that i am not able to hear the opinion of our friend mr fatuzzo on how short sea shipping affects the interests of european pensioners and secondly that so few members are present because considering the egotistical interests of this house it is probable that one day they will regret not having found out about the issue of short sea shipping because they will perhaps have to use it one day to travel to and from strasbourg
english turning to the background to the issue i must tell mrs peijs that we have followed with great interest the developments and actions which in recent years especially on the basis of the creation of the forum for the maritime industries have been taking place in the european union with a view to promoting short sea shipping as an alternative to land transport
english both the commission s report and the rapporteur s report illustrate the different comparative advantages of each type of transport of which in the case of sea transport i would like to highlight the fact that the infrastructures are less saturated the fact that they are less expensive they consume less energy and therefore emit fewer pollutants into the atmosphere and they improve communications with the outermost regions of the european union
english we consider and i think we all agree on this that the transfer of charges from land to sea transport should be taken as a priority objective of the european union s transport policy
english i would like to highlight the fact that in the last two years there have been a series of actions which have had positive effects on short sea shipping
english this has made it possible as the commission s report points out for intra community sea transport activity to increase by between and
english nevertheless this is a relatively modest increase of only cumulatively per year and this is less comparatively than the increase over the same period in land transport which has been
english consequently rather than bringing the relative positions of sea transport and road transport closer together the difference between them has continued to increase
english all of this indicates therefore that we not only need more vigorous quantitative measures but that we probably need a different qualitative focus
english mrs peijs s report seems to us to be very balanced but we would like to draw your attention to one of the key objectives for the promotion of short sea shipping the simultaneous reduction of the time and direct cost involved in port operations for ships which provide this type of service
english in many cases the port services both with regard to the ship and the goods are faced with no effective competition or with very limited competition and this means that there is often abuse of dominant positions such as the imposition of obligatory services which are not necessary or are not even used for example piloting towing mooring and port handling as well as the payment of very high tariffs
english what is certainly the case is that apart from very few exceptions transoceanic services do not have to face competition from roads and in most cases air transport does not offer any practical competition to them
english for all these reasons we believe that if the intention is to promote short sea shipping in a realistic and effective way it is essential to reorganise the current provision of port services by improving their efficiency and reducing their costs
english we should also bear in mind what this means for the economies of the areas in which there is a ship building industry
english this means a revitalisation of the whole area as is well known by the people who live in those cities in those regions in which the ship building industry is a very active element in the local economy
english mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen i was asked why are we so keen on short sea shipping at european level
english the answer is we have a vision
english we see large quantities of goods transported round our continent on safe environmentally friendly ships
english the goods are unloaded at the point where they can reach their destination via the shortest possible overland route
english that takes the burden off overland transport by adding another link to the chain of intermodal transport
english of course we are still many sea miles away from making this vision come true although some progress has been made over the past two years as the report shows
english mrs peijs good report describes the existing obstacles and the strategies for realising our visions
english there was broad agreement in committee
english what can we do internally for short sea shipping i just want to mention a few things
english in the technical field we can introduce more environmentally friendly technology for ships engines and specific terminals for express transhipment
english in the organisational field and especially for cross frontier transport we can introduce uniform shipping documentation simplified administrative procedures and fewer pilot services in cases where they are not absolutely necessary
english what can we do for short sea shipping as a link in the intermodal chain
english first we can improve the interfaces with other modes of transport by introducing modern systems of transhipment especially to inland shipping standardising containers promoting transport logistics services for the entire transport chain and by many other means mentioned in the report
english i think we should also consider all these matters with a view to our pre accession strategies
english meanwhile we have the activity of the round tables
english the report says that an exchange of best practice would be useful
english that is true for why have we been calling for some time now for a reference centre for intermodal transport
english it would be sensible to engage in more research and above all to set up demonstration projects in the field of intermodal transport
english all in all the report offers a whole package of sensible proposals
english i hope that the next progress report in two years time will tell us that we have moved a little closer to our vision our vision of a successful intermodal transport system in europe
english mr president there are three aspects of mrs peijs excellent report that i would like to highlight and illustrate by way of example
english although these come from my own constituency i know they are representative of many similar regions
english first intermodality and the need to optimise infrastructure links to the hinterland
english this week we have voted for environmentally friendly measures designed to encourage more freight on to rail
english good rail access into ports is vital in this context
english we have to accept however that there are times when it is roads that provide the necessary access into the hinterland
english i cite the placing on the tens map of the a from gretna to stranraer given its importance for sea transport to and from northern ireland
english second the extent to which outlying regions and islands depend on the sea for contacts with their neighbours
english we often look on the sea as something that separates communities we are better viewing it as a highway that connects them
english my group endorses amendments nos and accordingly
english i would add though that for environmental sustainability we should look upon connections between peninsulas in the same way
english in the west of scotland the route from gourock to dunoon is twenty times as far by road as it is by sea and that from tarbert to portavadie is twenty five times as far
english third it is essential that we continue to recognise the lifeline nature of many short sea shipping routes
english i am not thinking just in terms of the need to sustain public service obligations in this context
english we also need to find other permissible ways of reducing the costs associated with transport to island and outlying communities
english their economies are invariably fragile ones and it is just not good enough that the farmers on the isle of lewis have to pay twice as much for their hay as farmers living near inverness
english i hope the commission will take such points into serious consideration when developing policy in the area
english mr president in this group we welcome the peijs report and we welcome the commission s stance to which it is responding
english it is indeed true that short sea shipping is environmentally friendly and cost effective and it is indeed true that it supports the economic development of maritime regions but we in scotland call upon the commission therefore to get its act together in respect of the forthcoming liberalisation of sea transport in the west of scotland
english as mrs attwooll has just pointed out we not only have island transport there but also important short sea links across what we call sea lochs and the geologists call fjords where instead of going kilometres up a narrow road over a mountain pass you can take a boat across a narrow water
english if we were to interpret the regulation on maritime cabotage sensibly we would say of course these peninsulas are functionally equivalent to islands and public service obligations apply in these cases as well
english in that case it would be quite lawful for the state to support the services there
english in the same way one could then take a holistic look at the package of routes across the west of scotland instead of breaking it up inviting cherry picking by private entrepreneurs who come in to take the few paying routes and make it harder to sustain the routes which are not profitable all the year round
english we want a holistic look at that kind of thing throughout europe we want an imaginative approach by the commission
english it is six weeks since i put a question to the commission asking if it would treat the peninsulas as equivalent to islands
english earlier it had claimed intimate knowledge of the west of scotland
english it still have not replied to that
english i ask it to reply as a matter of urgency
english mr president mrs peijs ladies and gentlemen the commission s communication on the development of short sea shipping in europe and the very good report on it by mrs peijs give a realistic picture of the development of this environmentally friendly mode of transport in europe over the past two years
english the development and promotion of short sea shipping are a particularly important step on the way to developing a system of multimodal transport for the european union and bordering regions
english efficiency cost effectiveness environmental compatibility and sustainability distinguish this form of transport from road transport and can offer a serious alternative in coastal regions
english however it is also most important to improve the cooordination between the various modes of transport so as to bring out the specific strengths of each of them most effectively
english that is why the public and private sector must adopt a range of european national and regional aid measures to adapt and develop the ports which are the nerve centre of the transport chain and target these measures at the specific requirements
english furthermore it is important to adapt the related technical and organisational aspects such as administrative formalities and documents customs and embarkation procedures to ensure the rapid and smooth change from one mode of transport to another and from one country to another
english other support measures should include special incentives for the development of innovative technologies special pre embarkation terminals for short sea shipping and integrating the ports in the development strategy for the coastal regions
english this is an important means of strengthening economic and social cohesion and the links between the centres and the peripheral areas in the european union
english the integration of short sea shipping in the logistics chain of door to door delivery can be an effective means of sustaining the growing economic cooperation between the eu and its neighbouring states and satisfying the growing need for transport that accompanies it
english mr president i would like to say the following on behalf of mr van dam
english transport policy requires choices
english sustainable transport policy requires even more or at least other choices
english the task which we in this house have is to facilitate the transport of goods and passengers in such a way as to keep adverse side effects to a minimum
english the mode of transport we are discussing here short sea shipping has the reputation of being a mode of transport which can counter the negative effects of the transport sector especially in terms of the space occupied and environmental pollution in more than one way
english however as mrs peijs rightly points out the sector is not taking full advantage of the opportunities at the moment
english i would like to highlight a number of aspects
english we often hear that short sea shipping and transport by sea in general is an environmentally friendly mode of transport in terms of emissions per transported unit
english this is certainly true relatively speaking
english however progress made in this sphere in other sectors especially road transport is undermining this position
english if ports refuse to turn a ship swift action is most definitely required
english given the developments in the road transport sector as a result of new european emission standards for fuels i am of the opinion that in order to boost the environmental performance of short sea shipping we need to lay down a european directive concerning maximum permitted emission levels generated by ships engines
english furthermore unlike certain fellow delegates i am of the opinion that short sea shipping should not only supplement existing modes of transport it should also operate as an alternative to intra community transport
english given the problems surrounding distribution or with regard to reducing eco points in austria we very much welcome an alternative route from north to south and vice versa
english short sea shipping can take care of at least part of this
english a third aspect concerns the situation at ports
english if we want short sea shipping to become more competitive in terms of speed we will need measures to simplify customs and dis embarkation procedures the rapporteur is right to point this out
english if the sector then operates more efficiently and according to more up to date standards it is vital to broadcast its potential
english in a number of countries including the netherlands promotion offices have been set up successfully with this goal in mind
english it is therefore advisable for national or regional authorities to do their bit in order to develop this sector
english in short mrs peijs report is comprehensive and i would like to congratulate her on this
english if those involved take up their responsibilities we are bound to conclude in a number of years what the netherlands already knows x transport by sea the best route x
english mr president to visitors from afar the sea crossing to the scottish islands is the stuff of romance and indeed the beauty never fails to move both native and visitor
english but for those who live and make their living there the island shipping services are both an essential lifeline and a costly hurdle to be overcome for their economic and social well being
english the costs that impede are not only the fares difficult as those often are but also the inconvenience of pre booking of waiting in queues of fitting in with timetables which provide low and variable frequencies and then there are the risks of delays and cancellation due to weather or mechanical breakdown or strikes which hold the islands to ransom from time to time
english there is considerable concern on the scottish islands at the moment that the eu s competition policy which requires putting these services out to competitive tender will undermine these lifeline services even at their present level and add a further upward ratchet to the cost of living and of doing business
english we need to reassure those who live and work on these vulnerable islands and remote peninsulas that they have nothing to fear from bringing a measure of competition into the process for awarding these contracts
english can i ask the commission to do what it can to reassure the scottish islands the scottish executive that is struggling with this situation at the moment and the scottish parliament that it stands ready to make sure that this process works well that it does not undermine but improves the shipping services in the scottish islands
english perhaps through commission verheugen i can pass an invitation to the transport commissioner his colleague mrs de palacio to accompany me on a romantic trip to the scottish islands
english mr president commissioner living as i do in a country with an extensive coastline and many islands in fact i live on an island i have first hand experience of the value of short sea shipping
english of course the basic sector is passenger transport but the report under discussion focuses on freight transport in response to the commission s communication
english it is worth noting that although the volume of traffic carried by this form of transport has risen over recent years road transport has fared better meaning that special attention needs to be given to this more environmentally friendly form of transport
english the current situation is still pretty off putting for the public which is given the impression that this is a fairly outdated slow and complicated means of transport
english the development of maritime transport is further hampered by administrative procedures in need of improvement and delays an incomplete infrastructure and the obscure fees levied by some ports together with unnecessary mooring charges
english but we can still improve its image and turn it into a viable alternative solution for types of freight which can be transported by various methods
english i refer of course to places which are not restricted to maritime transport such as islands which must always warrant special attention
english the private sector has a basic role but there are aspects of the market which call for intervention by public sector agencies at regional national and european level and even financial aid so that islanders do not feel that they are second class europeans
english developing cabotage has an immediate impact on social and economic development in our regions and hence on the cohesion of the european union
english the rapporteur has obviously approached the subject matter in this spirit and has taken her work very seriously as an islander i feel obliged to extend her my special thanks
english i should also like to thank commissioner verheugen who i see has put his headphones on thank you for your attention earlier on during the explanations of vote by the honourable members
english mr president commissioner at a time when we are trying to correct regional disparities mrs peijs s report is very opportune since it deals with the matter of short sea shipping and asks member states and the commission to adopt measures to promote this type of transport
english as always i would like to remind you that the regional and structural policy of the union as a whole is a response to the specific disadvantages suffered by certain european regions such as the so called outermost regions
english last march the commission presented a report which lays out a strategy aimed at the sustainable development of those regions and which includes various principal aspects notably those regions relations with the areas in their geographical vicinity which to a certain extent largely condition their development
english therefore we believe that mrs peijs s report is opportune especially if it is reinforced by the amendment i have presented on the inclusion of sea transport between ports in the outermost regions and ports in the vicinity of those regions
english in this way we could correct the error made by the commission when it drew up the two yearly report on the development of this type of transport of employing an incomplete definition of short sea shipping
english mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen short sea shipping is the most economical most efficient and most suitable solution for remote regions
english i would like to thank mrs peijs for her interesting and excellent proposal
english in my own country shipping is almost totally of this short sea shipping type in other words it is important to us in that respect
english we are unusual in that we only have a land connection with the rest of the eu in the north so the importance of maritime traffic is enormous
english on top of everything our railways have a different gauge from those found elsewhere in the european union
english what is most peculiar about our situation is however that our shipping always comes to a halt in the winter unless certain measures are taken because the sea freezes
english this has led to a situation where we have had to establish a special fleet to break the ice
english they are powerful ships one ship s energy is equivalent to that used by a whole city
english this being the case as we have this hindrance to movement we hope that this ice breaking operation may be supported as the obstacle has been ordained by the lord and we cannot do a thing about it
english it is also to be regretted that the effects on employment and welfare of this sort of traffic have not been highlighted sufficiently
english a cheap workforce is a huge risk in these circumstances especially in the north and especially in ice
english how can someone wearing shorts who has no professional skill to his name cope in minus thirty degrees and three metres of ice
english that is the problem
english aircrews are always well trained but the same cannot be said of the cheap workforce that is employed on ships
english i expect the commission to look into this matter
english mr president i wish to congratulate mrs peijs on a successful report
english there are many problems and bottlenecks with regard to transport in europe roads and air space are congested and the competitiveness of the railways is poor
english this week here in parliament there have been many important reports on the subject of transport all aimed at relieving congestion and reducing bottlenecks
english mrs peijs s splendid report aims at exploiting the opportunities offered by short sea shipping
english it is an important addition to the reports on railways and air traffic
english we indeed need viable and competitive logistical chains linking road traffic rail transport short sea shipping and in addition modern information technology
english for remote countries across the seas and that includes finland short sea shipping is an absolutely vital necessity just as mr paasilinna there just said
english i wish to mention the importance of the suitability and availability of ports and port services
english ports must be included in the trans european network as part of the transport infrastructure
english for the measures proposed in the report to be implemented good levels of co operation will be required between the union member states players at local level and companies too as will genuine investment of time and money in short sea shipping
english mr president first of all i should like to congratulate the rapporteur on an excellent report
english quite clearly she has spent a lot of time on it and has brought a lot of problems to light
english we can see the different problems quite clearly from different areas of the european union
english each area has its own particular problem
english we have to recognise that it will take time to achieve our ultimate goal
english but there is no doubt that short sea shipping is something we must strive to achieve better than we have up to now
english it is certainly sensible to ship more goods by sea rather than by road
english it is more environmentally friendly more acceptable in every way
english but we have to ensure that we get the balance right
english that is what the rapporteur has been striving for
english one of the greatest problems will always be the cost factor
english to be competitive ports have to be more efficient and for this they will certainly require more support
english i support mrs attwooll s appeal for the a
english it recognises that we in northern ireland export goods across what is a very expensive stretch of water between northern ireland and scotland
english it is our main outlet for all we produce
english from scotland they trundle down to england
english there certainly could be a more efficient and environmentally satisfactory way of doing that but there is no cheaper way
english for our industry or agriculture to survive they have to be cost effective
english we had a very good ferry service set up between ballycastle and the south of scotland which was forced to close recently because of lack of support and bureaucracy
english mr president mrs peijs i should first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur on the quality of her report
english all the previous speakers have said this and like you regretted the fact that short sea shipping suffered from such a poor image in terms of its slowness and inefficiency even though it provides one solution to traffic congestion high infrastructure and environmental costs
english moreover in recent years this form of transport has enjoyed an unquestionable success even though it is not very well known or not well enough
english it does however offer as you said advantages in terms of costs energy efficiency regional cohesion the environment and even intermodality as it is an ideal means in the implementation of multimodal transportation
english measures must therefore be taken at the earliest possible opportunity to step up the efficiency of dockside operations and reduce waiting times in port
english speaking personally i would insist on the public authorities playing a part at regional as well as national and european levels
english there are however two points in your report that i have a problem with
english firstly the proposal to draw up a list of ports particularly suitable for short sea shipping
english i do not consider such a list to be necessary as it entails a risk of penalising the ports which are not currently entirely suitable but which are going to be modified in future
english moreover there is a suggestion that the logistical services offered to users should be combined in a single unit
english i am in favour of an information system but personally i reject the idea that a thriving major port should have central control of all the services
english finally i should have liked as a member of the industry committee to have heard someone say clearly that short sea shipping must not be considered as an alternative but that indeed an intermodal strategy should be found establishing complementarity between modes of transport
english in this context and in this spirit the member states should moreover harmonise their regulations so as to prevent distortions which particularly in the case of mainland transport often cause hold ups
english if we wish to achieve a multimodal system it is important to have a set of means of transport and regulations that are if not common to all then at least perfectly harmonised
english mr president let me thank mrs peijs for her excellent report and for the work she put into it
english the report show that short sea shipping is an issue on which there is the widest agreement between you the member states and the commission and the agreement goes further
english i know of no one and no organisation which does not wish to see short sea shipping developed
english in the past we were guilty of talking short sea shipping down
english we mentioned its potential and by doing so implicitly said that it was not really doing very well
english but it is doing well
english it was not much publicised but short sea shipping was the only mode of transport which during the s could more or less keep pace with the development of road transport
english so we must give credit to the short sea shipping industry
english however there is always room for improvement the shipping industry is the first to acknowledge this
english let me mention a few key issues in mrs peijs report
english we need a comprehensive approach to make this a genuine door to door concept
english it must be fully integrated in the transport chain and be offered through one stop shops
english several bottlenecks hamper the development of short sea shipping
english the commission services are currently identifying these bottlenecks and potential solutions together with the new member states and industry
english one area which has already been identified is the diversity of documents required
english to create more uniformity the commission intends to present a proposal by the end of the year aiming to harmonise certain ships arrival and departure documents
english the efficiency of ports is crucial for short sea shipping and also by the end of the year the commission will present a package of measures intended to enhance that efficiency through liberalisation
english further the old fashioned image of short sea shipping needs to be changed that was already mentioned in the debate and i appreciate that very much
english national short sea promotion offices should play an essential role in implementing this policy
english some promotion offices already exist and the commission encourages establishing further offices so that we can create a european network of promotion
english in the debate the question of community grants was raised and i would like to answer the question here
english the main source of community grants to short sea shipping has in the past been the pact programme that is a pilot action for combined transport
english last year around of the pact budget was used to favour combined short sea shipping and that amounts to eur million
english it will even be more in the we will increase the share up to
english the dg responsible aims to continue this trend so that short sea shipping will continue to receive its fair share of the pact budget
english in the forthcoming revision of pact this principle could even be incorporated into the legal text
english mr purvis has asked me to pass an invitation to commissioner de palacio
english i certainly will do that and mrs palacio will enjoy a romantic trip to scotland
english it would be even more romantic if you would invite me to accompany her
english mrs peijs thank you for your work
english thank you for ensuring that we all move in the same direction
english let us all do it together the commission will certainly do its best
english mr president i should like to express my disappointment that on a matter on which i have had a written question before the commission for more than six weeks and which i raised in the debate i have had no acknowledgement far less a reply
english thank you very much mr maccormick
english the vote will take place tomorrow friday at a m
english civil dialogue
english the next item is the oral question to the commission b on behalf of the committee on employment and social affairs on the future financing of the civil dialogue
english mr pronk has the floor
english mr president i hope that at this late stage we will not be taking up too much time
english it is unfortunate that we now have to round up this important debate which is important on its own merits
english if i can use this opportunity i would just like to say that it would perhaps be sensible if in future for example we do not manage to vote on a tuesday evening we could squeeze in an extra round of voting so that we do not incur further delays during the rest of the week
english you might be able to submit this to the bureau for their consideration
english but this is of course not really related to these issues
english i do not need to add too many explanatory notes
english firstly it is indisputable that non governmental organisations play a vital role in member states in the european union and outside of the european union everyone is agreed on this
english this is something which the council states and which is backed up frequently by the commission and this parliament
english also article of the european treaty in combination with declarations and underlines that cooperation with wohlfahrtsverb nde welfare associations is necessary and these are also non governmental organisations of course
english the european parliament has always put its money where its mouth is and has for some time for some considerable time created a line b in order to finance non governmental organisations
english however as a result of different provisions which have been agreed in conjunction with the council and following judgments by the court of justice this line has now more or less expired after three years
english the european commission has been aware of this for three years
english this is not the issue
english this issue is that so little is happening
english on the one hand the great need is staring us in the face while on the other we see little in the way of specific action except for the document which the commission has issued and which we are specifically asking after
english the six million dollar question now is how we can translate the finely worded ideas we have all expressed into reality
english what i am saying on my own behalf not on behalf of the commission is that bureaucratic issues are bound to crop up
english the reason for this could be that there are different commission directorates involved
english ngos are not restricted to one directorate general
english it could be that they are looking for a general angle and at the same time specific angles but at any rate this is all taking up too much time as the budget lines are expiring
english this is also the reason why we are drawing the commission s attention to this issue this evening in itself not a very appropriate time
english speed is the main issue
english it is not so much the commission s intention which is at issue but the speed with which certain things can be brought about
english we might otherwise run the risk of failing to implement not just a core task stipulated in the european treaty but also what has been stated by the european council in feira because ngos and this is the only problem are extremely sensitive at least the majority of them to breaks in payments to them
english they are far more sensitive to this than other organisations and certainly member states
english this means that if we wait around for too long the patient will die
english this is the serious concern which we have in our committee
english this is the reason why we are asking these questions and this is also the reason why we hope that the commission will tackle this matter with due haste within the scope which the treaty offers and within the generally benevolent climate which the council and commission have displayed in feira as witnessed by the european parliament
english mr president i can be extremely brief
english i thought the response by the commissioner was encouraging on its own merits
english i think he is right in stating that we in parliament should make every effort not to obstruct procedures
english i should point out however that we in parliament have tried our hardest using all the means at our disposal to keep those budget lines up and running that enabled us to continue financing ngos
english this can only be stretched so far and speed is then of the essence
english i would like to make one last point following on from the official reply by the commissioner on the intergovernmental conference
english it is in fact not so much the content of the present treaty or present declarations which is at issue in fact he is more concerned to adapt these declarations presumably in such a way as to form a legal basis from them so that a programme can be based on them
english this is the problem in fact and i would ask the commissioner whether it would be possible to give this matter further attention within the commission
english as such we are thus not asking for a new treaty but for some attention
english finally because we are of course involved in the development of ngos in the new member states in the context of enlargement we believe that this should be given extremely high priority
english mr president i am speaking on behalf of the group of the party of european socialists in support of mr pronk s words on behalf of the committee as a whole
english i have to say that i was not totally satisfied by the commissioners responses in that the documents that were referred to with which we are familiar as mr pronk said need to contain time frames and rather more practical decision
english as we know we have been discussing the issue for years
english parliament has played a fundamental role in this dialogue but it is now time to move on from dialogue and declarations to concrete action
english the commission needs to start putting forward practical solutions for otherwise the issue will never be resolved
english i can see a certain contradiction and i am concerned and i believe i speak for the rest of the committee on employment and social affairs as well that behaviour within the commission in relation to the issue appears to be somewhat contradictory
english the role of the non governmental organisations in the democratic construction of the union and the economic and social role they play in europe the entire social economy sector the third sector is now acknowledged in practice as well as in documents if we consider that approximately nine million workers are employed in this sector as a major sector of fundamental importance
english well the most recent decisions of the commission and i refer to the directorate general for industry have labelled this a negative priority they have now invented the concepts of positive and negative priorities and have abolished the social economy operative unit
english in my opinion this is extremely serious and leaves us extremely sceptical as to whether the declarations made repeatedly in this house which we have heard on several occasions will be followed by practical action in the right direction
english the ngo platform with which parliament and the commission have maintained dialogue and all those involved feel as if they have been taken for a ride and i think that we parliamentarians also feel rather as if we have been deceived when declarations are made saying one thing and then in reality practical decisions lead to another
english the absence of an interlocutor on the administrative side apart from anything else will make it all the more difficult to resolve these problems rather than making it easier
english so if we genuinely want to make positive progress speed up the procedures and provide positive responses for the european citizens as well as the non governmental organisations in my opinion we need to rethink a whole series of decisions which have been taken and most importantly change them
english mr president many of us in the group of greens and the european free alliance have our roots in the ngo and activist movement so it is very dear to our hearts
english earlier today we discussed the annual report of the committee on petitions that is the complaints end of the process of evaluating what is going on within the european union
english the ngos in our view act as part of the preventive process
english they provide a scrutiny mechanism they provide a way of making sure that we do not lose aspects of the legislation that we are doing
english they make us think of new things and they are essential to our process
english they are one of the few organisations which are really active on the citizens behalf and if we are trying to create confidence within the structures we are trying to build their role is absolutely essential
english it is really important that they are there to counterbalance a lot of the business interests which do not seem to have financial difficulties in finding a path to our door whereas for a lot of ngos working internationally is enormously expensive
english the work we have been doing in various committees over the last few weeks on article the anti discrimination article would have been impossible without the input of those bodies
english so the need to sort out a clear legal basis for their participation and hence their funding is absolutely essential because this body cannot work properly without them
english reference was made to the applicant countries and i would echo the words of my colleague mr pronk that the ngo and civil society movement in those countries is going to be essential if we are going to have a european union based on values of justice and democracy
english i would urge that we find a way of establishing a serious and reliable funding mechanism for those organisations that represent the poor the excluded and the discriminated against at least so that they are not scrabbling for funds every year wondering if they are going to survive so they can do the job they exist to do
english mr president in the last few years the eu has of course been given more and more significant powers in the social area but it has not been given an awful lot of money for solving social problems
english as long as the member states are of the basic opinion that social issues should be dealt with by the member states themselves there will be no rapid change
english we are of course aware that those funds which do exist are strictly budgeted for and that it is difficult to move funds around within the budget
english it is difficult to meet new needs while the member states have this attitude
english for these reasons i believe that it is particularly important for those of us who work in the eu institutions to concentrate on according much greater importance than we have until now to the non governmental public organisations in europe operating in the social sphere
english i am sure everyone can see that there is a need for transnational activities in the social sphere too
english there is therefore a place for non governmental organisations
english it would however be unfortunate and that is perhaps the way the member states see it if the non governmental social organisations were to be strongly bound financially and politically to the eu more so than they are already becoming
english their worth lies precisely in the fact that they are non governmental and civic and are able to see social problems from a different perspective than the authorities in that way they constitute a complement or alternative to the commission the council and parliament
english i will take the opportunity to make a suggestion despite there not being many people listening there are only around six meps in the house
english i propose that the commission try to set up a european fund for this purpose with the non governmental organisations in the social sphere
english i propose that the commission turn to the council and the member states to try to get them to contribute to such a fund
english this fund ought to be set up as an independent institution whose board of directors is made up of people from the social organisations themselves together with researchers and experts in the social sphere
english one might imagine that such an organisation would escape some of the bureaucratic problems
english financial supervision could be exercised by professional auditors
english i believe that if we set to work on a task like this with a certain diplomatic tactfulness the member states would react positively to the proposal
english i also believe that all other parties the socially disadvantaged the non governmental organisations the member states and the eu institutions would all be very pleased with such an institution
english you told us that the commission was active in meeting the operating costs of ngos but what we members of parliament want is to ensure that all ngos may be supported and funded on the basis of a number of practical projects
english for nowadays it is the major ngos which have the opportunity to respond to a number of invitations to tender medecins du monde medecins sans fronti res the red cross and so on and so forth that is my first comment
english you must be aware of the problems experienced by a good number of smaller ngos in being able to respond to a number of invitations to tender
english the work they do in terms of relations and competencies is however just as important as that of the major ngos but some of them do not have the same administrative facilities that some major ngos have
english secondly what we would also like to see is the needs of ngos being satisfied before a major tragedy occurs
english let me take just one example the protection of childhood
english for four years a number of members of parliament have been fighting for funding for associations working to combat child abuse
english our attempts have been ignored
english it was not until the dutroux case that we were able to obtain a budget line enabling two programmes to be run daphne and stop
english today regrettably only one programme is left the daphne programme
english i can tell you that as experts on matters to do with small children a number of ngos would indeed love to be able to respond to specific invitations to tender
english finally i feel it advisable to simplify the procedures and that in this connection i do not know if this has to be a fund the commission should at least initially make a service available to ngos enabling them to obtain information on the work carried out by other parties and possibly establish networks on certain topics in order ultimately to be able to submit tenders to the commission when offers come up
english that commissioner is what i wished to say
english we shall make progress in the social sector because we know that we have to make progress in terms of cooperation in that sector
english we need time for this
english this is precisely why given that social matters are essentially part of the remit of ngos we must make progress in the matter of civil dialogue
english mr president mrs lambert and mrs ghilardotti are right
english the european social ngos are playing a critical role in our work anyone who went through the article discrimination package could see this
english since the budget crisis which saw the freezing of funds destined for ngo work with some of the most vulnerable people in europe and the developing world much progress has been made
english the portuguese presidency broke new ground and invited the european aid platform to the lisbon informal social affairs summit and the french presidency is following suit
english these kinds of initiatives were recognised in the conclusions of the lisbon summit
english but words are not enough and two years after the budget crisis the difficulties continue
english there have been two years of consultations with ngos and all the commission has come up with is a discussion paper and two internal working groups which have hardly met
english meanwhile ngos and i worked in the ngo field are being squeezed by bureaucratic rules which were introduced to promote accountability and transparency but which in the end have created more red tape
english the troubles of ngos mr president are further compounded by this house when it makes difficult rules on co finance requirements which are set with the tightest deadlines
english the one budget line that we had b has been scrapped and the commission has failed to come up with a proposal for a legal base for the civil dialogue either through suggesting a council regulation or a treaty article
english worse the social ngos have been told by the commission that they will need to be funded through our new discrimination and social exclusion budget lines
english how can that be when the funds for those programmes have been reduced beyond what is reasonable
english a number of valuable social ngos are facing serious crises because of the inaction of the commission and the council
english i saw one ngo which made an application for projects requiring eighty pages of budget sheets and so many supporting papers that one ngo application weighed over twelve kilos
english mr president that has to change
english ngos are critical to our work and we must support them
english i would like to give warm thanks to all the members who took part in this debate for their suggestions as well as for their very strong criticisms
english i will pass them on and will raise them during the commission s debate
english let me just reply briefly to two points
english the first concerns the legal bases and the financing
english here we should not forget that one of the characteristics of a non governmental organisation is that it should not be dependent on public funding
english otherwise it ought to be called a governmental rather than a non governmental organisation
english so i do not have very much sympathy for the oft repeated call for governments or the commission to assure the financing of non governmental organisations in full
english all they can ever do is provide support and cooperate on projects
english that is quite fundamental
english a number of speakers have addressed the question of non governmental organisations and enlargement
english i will answer them because this matter is within my direct remit
english all the ideas i have heard put forward in this debate have long since become reality
english with our pre accession aid we are working very closely with the non governmental organisations in the candidate countries moreover our communications strategy the organisational and financial framework of which has now been established is also very much targeted at non governmental organisations in candidate countries since the aim is precisely to fully involve civil society in this important political process
english i will faithfully report everything else back to the commission without omitting to mention what i perceived to be the basically rather critical mood of this debate and i can assure you that i myself will certainly urge very strongly that procedures are simplified and decisions taken more rapidly
english thank you very much ladies and gentlemen
english the sitting was closed at p m
italian approvazione del processo verbale della seduta precedente
italian il processo verbale della seduta di ieri stato distribuito
italian vi sono osservazioni
italian signor presidente luned ho fatto un richiamo al regolamento in merito alle dichiarazioni che secondo la stampa britannica la presidente fontaine avrebbe rilasciato dopo essersi incontrata con sua maest la regina elisabetta ii
italian l onorevole miller un eurodeputato laburista britannico ha ripetuto in questa sede le affermazioni attribuite alla regina e non una volta soltanto ma in ben tre occasioni luned marted e mercoled
italian egli ha cercato di trascinare la regina in una controversia politica servendosi del nome di sua maest per ottenere un meschino successo politico
italian signor presidente forse la presidente fontaine non ha familiarit con le norme di protocollo che si applicano in queste circostanze in gran bretagna ma l onorevole miller non ha scusante alcuna
italian egli sa perfettamente che la regina un capo di stato senza poteri politici egli sa perfettamente che per quasi cinquant anni lei ha evitato di farsi coinvolgere in questioni politiche controverse egli sa perfettamente che la regina non pu venire in questo parlamento per rettificare le affermazioni che le sono state attribuite
italian il comportamento dell onorevole miller costituisce scandaloso
italian signor presidente sono orgoglioso della mia nazionalit britannica ma oggi mi vergogno di condividerla con quest uomo che sembra ignorare ogni sentimento di pudore e di rispetto
italian l onorevole miller dunque totalmente privo di onore e dignit
italian signor presidente come posso replicare a un attacco di tal fatta
italian quando ho sollevato la questione luned marted e mercoled ho chiesto all onorevole helmer di esprimere un parere sull euro ma finora egli si ben guardato dal raccogliere il mio invito
italian vorrei inoltre rilevare che nel colloquio con sua maest la regina la presidente fontaine ha posto alcune domande cui la regina ha risposto a nome del proprio governo che un governo laburista
italian questo forse non piacer all onorevole helmer ma mi duole dovergli ricordare che le cose stanno proprio cos
italian per concludere onorevole helmer sono scozzese sono britannico ma sono anche europeo e ne sono fiero
italian signor presidente approfitto di questo richiamo al regolamento per intervenire in qualit di presidente della delegazione per l america centrale e il messico
italian come tutti sanno signor presidente la scorsa domenica si sono tenute le elezioni in messico
italian la delegazione da me presieduta nell ambito della riunione tenuta oggi ha avuto l opportunit di discutere la relazione dei nostri colleghi che hanno assistito a tali elezioni come osservatori in rappresentanza del parlamento
italian signor presidente chiedo che la nostra risoluzione di cui ricever oggi il testo completo sia inviata alle autorit messicane dalla presidente del parlamento
italian molto bene onorevole seguro
italian ne informer senz altro la presidente fontaine
italian signor presidente onorevoli colleghi intervengo per segnalare un errore nel processo verbale che stato all origine di notevole malumore
italian del processo verbale fanno parte anche i testi approvati
italian ieri avevo fatto presente che la traduzione inglese dell articolo paragrafo della direttiva sulla lotta contro il riciclaggio di danaro su cui abbiamo votato doveva essere corretta in conformit dell emendamento n poiche la versione inglese sbagliata
italian il testo inglese contiene infatti a met del secondo paragrafo solo il riferimento alla rappresentanza nel procedimento giudiziario non quello alla consulenza giuridica che compare invece nel testo tedesco
italian si tratta peraltro di un punto di importanza decisiva per la direttiva e poiche il gruppo di lavoro del consiglio utilizza come testo base la versione inglese assolutamente necessario apportarvi le dovute correzioni
italian avevo gi segnalato il problema ai servizi linguistici durante la seduta della commissione ma in quell occasione si deciso di non presentare un emendamento in sede di commissione perche il testo originale quello tedesco essendo il tedesco la lingua del relatore
italian ieri ho nuovamente segnalato il problema dato che non era stato ancora risolto e ora lo risegnalo per la terza volta
italian ritengo che i servizi del parlamento dovrebbero prestare maggiore attenzione e cura a simili aspetti che rivestono importanza fondamentale e inaccettabile che nonostante le mie rimostranze di ieri il processo verbale contenga tuttora l errore da me evidenziato
italian la invito ad andare a fondo della questione e a far correggere la versione inglese in questo punto decisivo di grande rilevanza per la direttiva
italian certamente onorevole lehne
italian lei lo ha gi chiarito molto bene ieri provvederemo senz altro a far apportare la necessaria correzione
italian signor presidente ieri abbiamo ricevuto da parte del vicepresidente aderente al gruppo verts ale una lettera di colore giallo alla quale erano attaccate delle noci
italian nella missiva si afferma che occorre sostenere l esportazione dei prodotti di vanuatu un paese del pacifico in via di sviluppo
italian trovo che tale richiesta sia senz altro valida e seria e penso che la potr sostenere con piacere
italian c per un punto che non mi convince del tutto dove il vicepresidente dichiara espressamente che l importazione di queste noci da parte dell unione europea illegale
italian mi permetto d invitare il vicepresidente in questione a chiarire come sia avvenuta l importazione illegale delle noci da vanuatu visto che ce le ha date
italian mi pare di vedere una contraddizione in questa vicenda e vorrei che egli ce la spiegasse
italian ilarit e applausi
italian il parlamento approva il processo verbale
italian benvenuto
italian onorevoli colleghi ho il grande piacere di porgere oggi il benvenuto alla delegazione dell assemblea federale svizzera guidata dal suo presidente l onorevole marcel sandoz presente in tribuna d onore
italian i membri della delegazione sono in visita qui a strasburgo per incontrare i propri interlocutori del parlamento europeo in occasione del diciannovesimo incontro interparlamentare svizzera parlamento europeo
italian gli incontri sono iniziati ieri e proseguiranno nella giornata di oggi
italian fra i temi all ordine del giorno vi sono gli accordi bilaterali unione europea svizzera gli sviluppi futuri della politica d integrazione svizzera le prospettive della conferenza intergovernativa dell unione europea e il processo di ampliamento dell unione europea stessa
italian a nome di tutta la nostra assemblea auguro alla delegazione una proficua partecipazione alle riunioni e un piacevole soggiorno in questa stupenda citt di strasburgo
italian commissione per le petizioni mediatore europeo
italian l ordine del giorno reca in discussione congiunta presentate a nome della commissione per le petizioni le seguenti relazioni
italian a dell onorevole lambert sulle delibere della commissione per le petizioni nell arco dell anno parlamentare
italian a dell onorevole thors sulla relazione annuale di attivit del mediatore europeo per l anno
italian signor presidente sono lieto che mi si offra l occasione di informare il parlamento europeo sui risultati del mio lavoro in qualit di mediatore europeo per il
italian la relazione annuale per il riguarda l ultimo anno del primo mandato del mediatore europeo
italian l anno scorso l ufficio del mediatore ha ricevuto denunce con un incremento di quasi il percento rispetto alle del
italian il numero delle indagini avviate passato dalle del alle del registrando un aumento superiore al percento
italian la notoriet del mediatore europeo sta crescendo inoltre il nostro ufficio riceve una maggior quantit di denunce gravi che richiedono indagini approfondite
italian vi interesser sapere che abbiamo osservato questa tendenza anche nell anno in corso nei primi sei mesi del il numero delle nuove indagini salito del percento rispetto allo stesso periodo del
italian tra le attivit del mediatore europeo le indagini sono quelle che richiedono il maggior impiego di risorse quindi estremamente impegnativo far fronte a quest incremento cercando al contempo di mantenere la qualit del nostro lavoro e di rispettare l obiettivo di concludere gran parte delle inchieste nel giro di un anno
italian spero che il parlamento europeo aiuti il mediatore ad ottenere le risorse necessarie per svolgere efficacemente la propria opera
italian pi del percento delle denunce da noi ricevute nel esulava dal mandato del mediatore europeo tale percentuale ha registrato addirittura un leggero aumento probabilmente a causa del sempre maggiore numero di denunce che ci giungono per posta elettronica
italian siamo pi che disposti ad accettare denunce per posta elettronica molte delle quali riguardan o riguardavan casi concreti o presunti di cattiva amministrazione
italian nel complesso gran parte delle denunce inviate per posta elettronica diretta contro le autorit degli stati membri
italian l anno scorso allorche si era in procinto di eleggere il mediatore europeo alcune voci critiche suggerirono di ampliare il suo mandato cos da includere le denunce contro gli stati membri che riguardassero casi relativi alla normativa dell unione europea
italian mi chiedo se costoro avessero ben compreso che ci significherebbe accollare al mediatore europeo compiti attualmente di competenza della commissione europea nella sua veste di custode del trattato e del parlamento europeo nella sua veste di istanza democratica alla quale i cittadini possono indirizzare petizioni
italian noi esaminiamo attentamente tutte le denunce che ci pervengono soprattutto se riguardano diritti sanciti dalla normativa comunitaria
italian nel siamo riusciti ad assistere il ricorrente o a trasmettere la denuncia all autorit competente all incirca nella met dei casi di questi sono stati inviati al parlamento europeo perche li esaminasse come petizioni inoltre abbiamo informato altri ricorrenti del diritto di presentare una petizione al parlamento europeo
italian in molti casi delle denunce sporte contro enti od organismi nazionali regionali o locali si sarebbe potuto occupare efficacemente un mediatore nazionale
italian in ogni stato membro dovrebbe esistere un autorit non giudiziaria in grado di assistere i cittadini europei nelle controversie con l amministrazione degli stati membri relativamente ai diritti previsti dalla normativa comunitaria
italian quale sostenitore della sussidiariet sono convinto che la maniera pi efficace di raggiungere questo risultato sia lo sviluppo di una rete di cooperazione con questi mediatori e organismi analoghi come le commissioni per le petizioni
italian assieme al mediatore francese signor stasi abbiamo organizzato un seminario per i mediatori nazionali e gli organismi analoghi
italian l onorevole perry primo vicepresidente della commissione per le petizioni ha rappresentato il parlamento europeo nel corso del convegno svoltosi settembre a parigi
italian un altro seminario previsto a bruxelles per il quando il belgio assumer la presidenza del consiglio in collaborazione con la commissione e con i mediatori belgi a livello regionale e federale
italian l anno scorso i mediatori regionali e gli organismi analoghi sono stati invitati a firenze per una riunione cui era presente anche l onorevole gemelli presidente della commissione per le petizioni i mediatori regionali e gli organismi analoghi saranno anche invitati a bruxelles l anno prossimo
italian i mediatori e gli organismi analoghi degli stati membri hanno dimostrato un ampia disponibilit a collaborare con il mediatore europeo e sono fermamente convinto che cooperando con loro su basi paritarie sar possibile ottenere risultati soddisfacenti per i cittadini europei
italian inizialmente si temeva che il mediatore europeo non disponesse dei poteri sufficienti per aiutare in maniera concreta i cittadini
italian questi timori si sono rivelati infondati poiche le istituzioni e le autorit comunitarie hanno collaborato con il mediatore
italian dall inizio della loro attivit esse sono riuscite a ricomporre pi di controversie con piena soddisfazione del ricorrente
italian per esempio si sono occupate della corrispondenza inevasa hanno effettuato i dovuti pagamenti e annullato precedenti decisioni sfavorevoli
italian tutto ci indice di una tempestivit e di una flessibilit superiori a quelle da me sperimentate nei miei contatti con le amministrazioni nazionali
italian sessantadue di queste composizioni hanno avuto luogo lo scorso anno riducendo il margine d applicazione delle soluzioni amichevoli proposte dal mediatore
italian abbiamo comunque ottenuto una soluzione amichevole nel per un caso in cui commissione e consiglio hanno concordato che il ricorrente aveva diritto a ricevere l importo dovutogli per il suo lavoro di coordinatore regionale dell unione europea addetto al monitoraggio delle elezioni palestinesi
italian qualora l istituzione o l autorit interessata non risolvano direttamente i casi di cattiva amministrazione l unica alternativa che rimane al mediatore quella di presentare una raccomandazione seguita se necessario da una relazione speciale al parlamento europeo
italian cinque anni fa molti sostenevano che le istituzioni e le autorit comunitarie non prestavano la dovuta attenzione al parlamento europeo
italian forse allora era cos ma la situazione decisamente mutata a partire dal trattato di amsterdam e dopo la caduta della commissione santer
italian nel abbiamo presentato dieci proposte di raccomandazioni
italian in sette casi l istituzione interessata ha accettato le proposte in questione
italian in due casi il mediatore ha inoltrato una relazione speciale al parlamento europeo
italian un caso ancora pendente dal momento che europol ha bisogno di pi tempo per garantire un maggior accesso del pubblico ai documenti come previsto dalla posposta di raccomandazione
italian credo che le attivit del mediatore europeo abbiano ormai raggiunto il livello che si pu esigere da un organismo nuovo composto da persone che operano in un ambiente giuridico piuttosto complesso
italian stiamo ottenendo dei risultati per i cittadini europei e questo ci che importa
italian vorrei approfittare di quest occasione per ringraziare tutte le istituzioni e le autorit comunitarie per un altro anno di cooperazione costruttiva
italian in particolare mi rivolgo alla commissione e al commissario responsabile signora de palacio ringraziandola per aver continuato l opera del suo predecessore a favore di una cooperazione onesta e costruttiva con il mediatore
italian desidero altres esprimere il mio pi sincero apprezzamento per la disponibilit e la collaborazione offerte all ufficio del mediatore dalla commissione per le petizioni e soprattutto dal suo vicepresidente onorevole gemelli infine vorrei ringraziare la relatrice della commissione per le petizioni onorevole thors per la sua eccellente ed esaustiva relazione
italian vi ringrazio per l attenzione
italian signor presidente la relazione che presento questa mattina si compone di due parti l una riflette il lavoro svolto dalla commissione stessa l altra l opera della onorevole banotti mediatore del parlamento per i rapimenti transnazionali di minori
italian desidero quindi esprimere il mio personale apprezzamento per il lavoro del mediatore europeo s derman
italian vorrei anche ringraziare la segreteria della commissione soprattutto per la ripartizione statistica che stata effettuata e che devo confessarlo non opera mia
italian esorto i deputati che non hanno dimestichezza con la commissione per le petizioni a leggere queste relazioni che potrebbero dimostrarsi utili per la loro opera a favore di coloro che rappresentano
italian vorrei anche attirare l attenzione dei deputati sul sito che viene citato dalla relazione e che stato istituito nell ambito dell iniziativa europa in diretta esso potrebbe fornire informazioni utili e forse evitare la necessit di una petizione o al contrario confermarne l opportunit come utile strumento
italian cresce la necessit di questo tipo di informazioni poiche l opinione pubblica acquista sempre maggiore consapevolezza dell importanza e del significato delle iniziative prese a livello di unione europea
italian l obiettivo della commissione per le petizioni di fornire un servizio valido ed efficiente ai singoli cittadini dell unione europea e alla societ civile in generale
italian qualunque individuo cittadino residente o gruppo pu rivolgere petizioni al parlamento ogniqualvolta ritenga che il diritto o i principi della comunit non vengano applicati adeguatamente a qualsiasi livello
italian l anno scorso abbiamo ricevuto petizioni delle quali sono state giudicate ricevibili
italian ne ricorder soltanto due per dimostrare l ampia gamma di argomenti e la potenziale efficacia del meccanismo
italian una cittadina britannica riuscita ad ottenere il riconoscimento della sua precedente esperienza didattica da parte delle autorit francesi il che probabilmente influir sul suo salario e sulle sue possibilit di carriera
italian in un altro caso una petizione presentata da un cittadino spagnolo che agiva a nome di un associazione ambientalista ha dato avvio a una procedura di violazione contro le autorit spagnole in relazione alla direttiva sugli habitat causa frequente di denunce la direttiva non le autorit e ha prodotto effetti durevoli a livello nazionale
italian casi di questo tipo forniscono un feedback importante al parlamento europeo e alle altre istituzioni sulle modalit operative della nostra legislazione a favore o a detrimento secondo i casi degli individui e della societ
italian non avremmo potuto svolgere il nostro lavoro in seno alla commissione in maniera efficace senza il sostegno dei numerosi funzionari della commissione che conducono le indagini e se necessario promuovono procedure quindi vorrei porgere loro i nostri pi sentiti ringraziamenti
italian sappiamo che potremmo fornire un servizio pi rapido ed efficace se gli stati membri rispondessero con altrettanto impegno alle richieste di informazioni e spiegazioni
italian in un caso di cui ci stiamo occupando sono stati necessari mesi perche una lettera ottenesse risposta e non si tratta di un caso isolato
italian ecco perche raccomandiamo che alle riunioni della nostra commissione assistano il consiglio o un adeguata rappresentanza permanente affinche possano comprendere a fondo i problemi dei cittadini e rispondere efficacemente
italian se un rappresentante del consiglio fosse presente in questo momento vorrei attirare la sua attenzione sui punti e della relazione
italian la nostra commissione intende migliorare la qualit complessiva dei nostri meccanismi di feedback nella relazione troverete alcune delle nostre idee altre compariranno in un altra relazione che sar presentata dagli onorevoli perry e ke ler nel mese di settembre
italian proponiamo come gi abbiamo fatto l anno scorso di realizzare una banca dati cos che gli autori delle petizioni e i deputati possano seguirne il corso ed individuare gli eventuali problemi
italian confidiamo che le autorit competenti ne tengano conto quest anno e accolgano questa proposta
italian ci sono vari punti che riguardano i nostri rapporti con le altre commissioni chiediamo loro di contattare pi spesso la commissione per le petizioni per esprimere un opinione su alcuni settori di particolare interesse
italian vorremmo essere coinvolti nella preparazione di relazioni comuni su temi rilevanti quali l ambiente la previdenza sociale la tutela dei consumatori eccetera
italian vorremmo anche sfruttare l esperienza acquisita dai membri della nostra commissione attraverso il loro lavoro in altre commissioni del parlamento per realizzare un sistema basato sulla centralit del relatore per temi specifici
italian desideriamo inoltre instaurare rapporti con le commissioni per le petizioni di altri stati membri per favorire lo scambio di idee e la comprensione reciproca
italian la nostra commissione ritiene che le petizioni rappresentino uno strumento prezioso ed efficace per la democrazia in quella che pu spesso apparire un istituzione remota e anonima
italian dobbiamo apprezzare questo meccanismo e sfruttare l esperienza di coloro che rappresentiam esperienza che emerge dalle loro petizion per migliorare globalmente il nostro lavoro
italian raccomando al parlamento di approvare la relazione
italian signor presidente signora commissario signor mediatore la valutazione data dal relatore e dalla commissione alla relazione del mediatore europeo per il anno contraddistinto dalla crisi in seno alle istituzioni dell unione e da una sfiducia generalizzata verso l amministrazione comunitari la seguente i cittadini legittimeranno l integrazione europea soltanto se si vedranno riconosciuti diritti tali da consentire loro di partecipare a un dialogo politico con le istituzioni
italian il dialogo politico tuttavia non sar un vero dialogo se i cittadini non avranno diritto all informazione e accesso ai documenti desiderati se le loro opinioni non verranno tenute in considerazione esaminate e prese sul serio
italian che cosa ha tutto ci a che vedere con la missione del mediatore
italian secondo il relatore tale missione consiste nell indagare sui casi di cattiva amministrazione presso le istituzioni e all interno degli organismi comunitari
italian su esortazione del parlamento europeo nella relazione per il il mediatore aveva fornito una definizione di cattiva amministrazione
italian si pu parlare di cattiva amministrazione quando un ente pubblico omette di agire in ottemperanza a norme o principi vincolanti per tale ente pubblico
italian nel precedente mandato del mediatore le istituzioni hanno concordato l applicazione di tale definizione che rappresenta quindi per il momento e per il futuro il punto di partenza dell attivit del mediatore
italian nella relazione la commissione sottolinea che questa definizione comunemente accettata di cattiva amministrazione contempla anche il diritto di esaminare in che modo le istituzioni interpretino il diritto comunitario
italian a prescindere dalla forma giuridica definitiva della carta dei diritti fondamentali essa rappresenter comunque un espressione delle comuni tradizioni costituzionali degli stati membri che l unione tenuta a rispettare in base all articolo del trattato essendovi perci tenuti anche gli organismi e le istituzioni comunitarie
italian la commissione rileva inoltre che il mediatore ha un importante ruolo da svolgere per quanto concerne l applicazione della futura carta dei diritti dei cittadini
italian la nostra commissione ha inoltre espresso pieno sostegno a una carta dei diritti fondamentali che includa regole tali da conferire ai cittadini il diritto a una buona amministrazione all interno dell unione
italian buona amministrazione intesa come contrario di cattiva amministrazione
italian il diritto a una buona amministrazione sia per quanto concerne la carta di diritti dei cittadini che per quanto concerne il codice di buona condotta chiesti dal parlamento e dal mediatore deve contemplare come minimo il diritto di essere ascoltati in relazione al proprio caso il diritto di accesso agli atti il diritto a una risposta celere da parte dell amministrazione il diritto a una risposta motivata
italian tutti questi aspetti hanno rivestito un ruolo fondamentale nel lavoro svolto dal mediatore
italian questi diritti rappresentano il presupposto di quella cittadinanza attiva di cui l unione ha bisogno per poter riguadagnare la fiducia dei cittadini
italian sono questi diritti a far s che la cittadinanza non sia passiva ma attiva
italian una buona amministrazione pu gettare le basi per una cittadinanza attiva mentre una cattiva amministrazione pu minarle
italian quali sono le categorie pi comuni di denunce presentate al mediatore
italian diniego di informazioni o informazioni incomplete ritardi che si sarebbero potuti evitare discriminazioni negazione del diritto alla difesa
italian i cittadini chiedono un amministrazione adeguata e chiedono di essere cittadini attivi
italian queste sono le conseguenze che si traggono esaminando l oggetto delle sempre crescenti denunce al mediatore europeo
italian il mediatore si distinto per il suo operato a favore di una maggiore pubblicit degli atti
italian a tale proposito d uopo tributargli un grande elogio
italian diversi anni fa un indagine avviata di propria iniziativa ha fatto s che oggi la maggior parte delle istituzioni e degli organismi comunitari sia dotata di norme concernenti l accesso del pubblico agli atti
italian il mediatore ha proseguito instancabilmente il suo lavoro per assicurare una vera trasparenza e per evitare che la riservatezza dei dati e la tutela della privacy possano essere sfruttate per negare al pubblico la trasparenza
italian passo dopo passo il mediatore ha costruito il proprio lavoro adoperandosi per una migliore amministrazione conquistando la fiducia dei cittadini
italian e inoltre importante la cooperazione instaurata con i mediatori nazionali e in seguito anche con i corrispondenti organismi dei paesi candidati
italian si tratta di un lavoro valido che il parlamento deve sostenere
italian ci dovrebbe accadere mettendo a disposizione del mediatore risorse sufficienti cosicche egli possa svolgere le impegnative indagini imposte dal suo mandato
italian anche in futuro quindi dovremo appoggiare un mediatore indipendente nelle sue decisioni
italian rivolgo un sentito ringraziamento al mediatore e al suo staff nonche alla segreteria della commissione per le petizioni che come sappiamo lavora in condizioni difficili
italian signor presidente la commissione per le petizioni del parlamento europeo un organo particolare
italian infatti come hanno giustamente sottolineato le due oratrici che mi hanno preceduto essa vaglia le denunce presentate da cittadini che vedono lesi i propri diritti sanciti dalla cittadinanza dell unione
italian in qualit di relatore di un parere sul diritto di soggiorno vorrei fare alcune osservazioni sui particolari problemi che esistono in questo campo
italian la libera circolazione delle persone una delle libert fondamentali che abbiamo ottenuto grazie all integrazione europea
italian con la firma del trattato di maastricht stato introdotto un diritto generale di soggiorno di cui si pu godere a condizione di possedere sufficienti mezzi di sostentamento e di disporre di un adeguata tutela assicurativa sulle malattie
italian la libert di circolazione e il diritto di soggiorno possono essere limitati soltanto in presenza di motivi di ordine pubblico di sicurezza e di salute
italian l esperienza della commissione per le petizioni dimostra che nella pratica l esercizio del diritto alla libera circolazione si scontra con numerose difficolt a causa di tre ordini di fattori primo la lentezza con cui le disposizioni del diritto comunitario vengono attuate da parte degli uffici responsabili negli stati membri secondo i problemi relativi all esercizio della professione legati al riconoscimento di diplomi e titoli di studio terzo la mancata applicazione delle disposizioni in materia di previdenza sociale a causa ad esempio della complessit dei moduli da riempire per poter ottenere il rimborso delle spese mediche sostenute
italian un analisi delle procedure avviate per infrazione dei trattati nel periodo rivela che in casi si riscontrato un nesso diretto tra la petizione presentata e la procedura di infrazione aperta dalla corte di giustizia europea
italian purtroppo il consiglio dei ministri ignora spesso le comunicazioni inviategli dalla commissione per le petizioni sulle gravi violazioni commesse dalle autorit degli stati membri contro il diritto comunitario un fatto che testimonia dell atteggiamento negativo verso il diritto di petizione di cui godono i cittadini europei
italian in futuro il consiglio dovrebbe riservare la dovuta attenzione ai diritti dei cittadini dell unione
italian signor presidente il diritto di presentare petizioni e denunce non un invenzione dei tempi moderni
italian gi duemila anni fa i postulanti potevano esporre i propri problemi agli imperatori romani
italian questo diritto per ha sempre corso il rischio di essere modificato limitato o abolito
italian i postulanti di allora sono diventati gli emancipati cittadini europei di oggi
italian nessuna amministrazione e nessuna istituzione sono infallibili
italian molte petizioni denunciano incongruenze tra le disposizioni di legge e l integrazione europea
italian le petizioni sono quindi una cartina al tornasole dei rapporti tra il cittadino e il legislatore
italian esse affrontano un ampia gamma di problematiche che vanno dalla colonia di criceti in un area industriale al divieto di utilizzare protesi al silicone fino all introduzione di una tassa sugli automezzi pesanti
italian per quanto concerne il mediatore europeo il mio gruppo si congratula con lui per il lavoro svolto nel
italian il merito del mediatore s derman stato ed quello di impegnarsi soprattutto per assicurare una maggiore trasparenza ed apertura nelle amministrazioni europee
italian poiche la maggior parte delle denunce di competenza del mediatore riguardano la commissione europea e sono motivate dall assenza di trasparenza necessario adoperarsi per migliorare questa situazione
italian a tal fine occorre garantire l accesso ai documenti non solo ai cittadini europei ma anche al mediatore
italian l utilizzo negli uffici delle nuove tecnologie non pu essere una scusa per impedire la trasparenza
italian dare ai cittadini risposte concrete e motivate significa creare un clima di fiducia un comportamento di segno contrario invece non solo ingenera sfiducia ma fa anche aumentare il numero di denunce da esaminare il che comporta nuovi oneri
italian particolarmente lodevole l iniziativa del mediatore a favore di un codice di buona condotta amministrativa
italian il cittadino ha il diritto fondamentale ad essere governato da un amministrazione trasparente responsabile e che operi in uno spirito di servizio considerato che lui in quanto contribuente a finanziare l amministrazione
italian attribuisco grande importanza al ruolo indipendente svolto dal mediatore europeo che pu fungere da esempio per l istituzione della figura del mediatore nazionale nei paesi candidati e nel mio land la turingia
italian signor presidente signor mediatore i liberal ed io in prima person sono orgogliosi del coraggio dell attivismo e della determinazione del mediatore
italian e essenziale che esista una persona di tanta integrit che ha avuto il coraggio di battersi per la trasparenza e l apertura contro la cultura dell insabbiamento del segreto e in alcuni casi purtroppo persino della frode e della corruzione esistenti anche in seno alle istituzioni europee
italian soltanto un amministrazione trasparente e aperta pu guadagnarsi il sostegno dei politici che lavorano qui e dei cittadini che rappresentano
italian la linea portata avanti dal mediatore gode di vasto consenso fra i cittadini di tutti gli stati membri
italian e un dato di fatto incontrovertibile come dimostrato in pi relazioni scientifiche internazionali l incontestabile legame esistente fra elevato grado di trasparenza e pubblicit nell amministrazione da un lato e basso livello di corruzione dall altro
italian anche il contrario vero ossia che un amministrazione chiusa e piena di segreti tende a registrare un grado di corruzione pi elevato
italian ci vale anche per le istituzioni europee
italian ecco perche tanto importante disporre di un mediatore indipendente e in grado di agire in modo autonomo senza alcun tipo di pressioni o di interessi che tentino di influenzarne l operato
italian anche la crescente quota di denunce provenienti dai cittadini dimostra la necessit di disporre di un mediatore che agisca nell interesse dei cittadini
italian l unica critica che possibile rivolgere al mediatore consiste nel fatto che questa istituzione purtroppo ancora poco conosciuta in troppi stati membri e che sono pochi i cittadini al corrente di questo diritto
italian ecco un aspetto sul quale in futuro ritengo che ci dovremo concentrare
italian per ricapitolare il mediatore svolge una funzione molto importante
italian mi congratulo con lui per il lavoro svolto nel corso dell anno e gli auguro buona fortuna per il futuro
italian signor presidente signora commissario signor mediatore forse bene ricordare che soltanto un anno e mezzo fa in questa sede si discusso sulla necessit o meno della commissione per le petizioni
italian sono molto contenta di poter constatare che la commissione per le petizioni ha nuovamente dimostrato di essere indispensabile specie se vogliamo rafforzare la posizione del cittadino nell unione europea
italian spero proprio che l anno prossimo la commissione per le petizioni riuscir ad attuare una proficua cooperazione con le altre commissioni credo infatti che possiamo elaborare relazioni comuni sulle problematiche pi rilevanti
italian per quanto concerne il mediatore questi ha rinsaldato la propria posizione e riconfermato la propria indipendenza il crescente numero di denunce la dimostrazione del fatto che i cittadini ne hanno scoperto l esistenza noi parlamentari abbiamo spesso potuto indirizzare a lui i cittadini per ottenere una risoluzione ai loro problemi
italian in futuro ci occuperemo della questione legata alla pubblicit dei documenti sulla quale abbiamo ottenuto valide informazioni dal mediatore
italian signor presidente in un minuto si pu dire molto poco per cui sar sintetica
italian in primo luogo vorrei esprimere la mia gratitudine alla relatrice lambert per aver accolto nel corso del dibattito tutte le nostre proposte
italian proprio per questo non sono stati neppure presentati emendamenti
italian in secondo luogo vorrei dire che a questo punto nessuno nutre dubbi sul fatto che la commissione per le petizioni e il mediatore europeo contribuiscano in maniera assai importante a far rispettare il diritto comunitario
italian lo stiamo vedendo tutti i giorni in seno alla commissione per le petizioni
italian pertanto anch io come la onorevole hautala sono estremamente lieta che la commissione per le petizioni sia sopravvissuta ai tentativi di farla scomparire dato che oltre a chiedere il rispetto del diritto comunitario essa la commissione pi vicina ai cittadini
italian e la commissione che rende le istituzioni pi visibili ai cittadini
italian probabilmente il problema pi rilevante quello delle lunghe procedure che seguono la denuncia presentata da un cittadino
italian un cittadino deve studiare il diritto comunitario per poter presentare una petizione per poi vedere mese dopo mese come la risposta tardi ad arrivare
italian le petizioni pi importanti riguardano argomenti sociali e relativi all ambiente che sono i temi che pi ci preoccupano
italian signor presidente in alcune occasion e qui concludo quando si denuncia l espulsione di un cittadino oppure la distruzione di una zona naturale la risposta arriva a fatto compiuto quando non c pi nulla da fare
italian lo snellimento delle procedure pertanto una questione importante che la onorevole lambert ha saputo evidenziare
italian signor presidente i deputati radicali della lista bonino sosterranno le due relazioni cos come apprezzano e sostengono il lavoro del mediatore
italian ma al mediatore vorremmo rivolgere una domanda precisa e puntuale in merito al fatto che ancora non esiste la possibilit di presentare denunce utilizzando la firma elettronica
italian e un problema questo che secondo noi riguarda tutte le istituzioni anche per quello che concerne il lavoro all interno del parlamento ma in particolare proprio perch il mediatore impegnato e interessato acche ci sia la massima attenzione verso il proprio lavoro pensiamo che la firma elettronica per quanto concerne il mediatore pu essere il primo atto per introdurre l uso di questo strumento all interno delle istituzioni
italian vorrei solamente estrapolare un passaggio importante che stato sottovalutato
italian il percento delle denunce ricevibili concernono la commissione
italian il mediatore ci ha detto che quest anno non sono stati compiuti progressi nel campo della trasparenza da parte della commissione trasparenza che uno strumento efficace contro la frode e la corruzione
italian in particolare il presidente prodi il dicembre si era impegnato a trovare e a proporre delle soluzioni giuridiche e organizzative per dare ai candidati ai concorsi interni ed esterni della commissione la possibilit di accedere ai propri elaborati d esame
italian vorremmo sapere dal mediatore cos come ci ha ricordato che europol ha ancora bisogno di tempo se l impegno preso il dicembre dal presidente prodi di concedere l accesso agli elaborati per il luglio di gi operativo
italian signor presidente onorevoli colleghi dalla relazione annuale del mediatore europeo apprendo che il motivo principale per cui i cittadini presentano denunc come abbiamo teste udit la mancanza di trasparenza
italian a quanto pare non tutte le parti interessate sono consapevoli dell esistenza di questo problema
italian la commissione ha presentato una proposta di regolamento sull accesso pubblico ai documenti che lei mediatore s derman ha giustamente e pubblicamente criticato in quanto non abbastanza ampia
italian abbiamo potuto leggere qualcosa al riguardo
italian da quale spirito sia mossa questa proposta si pu evincere leggendo quanto affermato dal comitato di esperti indipendenti
italian nella seconda relazione riportato che cito la commissione come tutte le istituzioni politiche necessita di spazi per riflettere al fine di definire la sua politica prima che essa diventi di dominio pubblico giacche una politica fatta davanti all opinione pubblica spesso una cattiva politica
italian per me nella mia veste di rappresentante dell opinione pubblica europea un simile approccio alle questioni inerenti alla trasparenza e alla politica in generale inaccettabile
italian pertanto mediatore s derman appoggio vivamente le sue critiche del tutto giustificate
italian signor presidente vorrei porgere anch io le mie congratulazioni e i miei ringraziamenti al mediatore per la relazione che ha presentato quest anno nonche alle onorevoli thors e lambert per le relazioni che hanno sottoposto al parlamento
italian tutte e tre le relazion soprattutto quella del mediator sono la prova del lavoro serio e attendibile che stato svolto nel corso dell anno
italian certamente i cittadini europei hanno bisogno di qualcuno a cui rivolgersi se hanno problemi con l amministrazione so che il signor s derman un mediatore affidabile
italian ne ho avuto la prova quando ho partecipato al seminario di parigi stato un piacere constatare il rispetto di cui gode il mediatore europeo presso i suoi omologhi nazionali
italian da questo lato dell emiciclo siamo convinti che il mediatore debba avere tutti i poteri di cui ha bisogno per adempiere le proprie responsabilit
italian per quanto riguarda l accesso ai documenti riteniamo che le opinioni della commissione per gli affari costituzionali siano indubbiamente importanti ma ci non significa che nutriamo dubbi sul diritto del mediatore di accedere ai documenti su questo punto egli pu contare sul nostro appoggio incondizionato
italian e sorprendente pensare che soltanto lo scorso anno la commissione per le petizioni si trovava in una situazione alquanto precaria la relazione della onorevole lambert illustra l eccellente opera svolta dalla commissione per le petizioni
italian insieme al nostro presidente onorevole gemelli stiamo cercando di rendere la nostra commissione pi efficace e pi efficiente nel lavoro che svolge a nome dei cittadini
italian una delle cose pi importanti che presenteremo al parlamento un codice di buona condotta amministrativa
italian i cittadini e i funzionari delle istituzioni sanno che cosa sia una condotta ragionevole e quindi dispongono di standard a cui fare riferimento
italian infine vorrei ringraziare la commissione per il sostegno offerto alla nostra commissione un sostegno valido e costante per tutto l anno
italian spero che anche durante la presidenza francese otterremo lo stesso appoggio da parte del consiglio appoggio che sfortunatamente ci venuto a mancare in passato
italian signor presidente anzitutto mi complimento con le due relatrici per le interessanti osservazioni formulate
italian abbracciando sfere d attivit sempre nuove che ormai comprendono un ampio spettro di interessi dei cittadini l unione europea si trasforma in un moderno leviatano con gli inevitabili abusi che accompagnano qualsiasi strumento amministrativo e che in certo qual modo tendono a essere pi pericolosi di quelli a livello di servizi nazionali
italian la ragione di ci che i meccanismi di controllo non hanno seguito l evolversi dell attivit
italian esistono tre modi per scongiurare i pericoli derivanti dall esteso meccanismo amministrativo dell unione
italian il primo rappresentato dal pi diretto e frequente coinvolgimento del parlamento nel controllo delle singole attivit degli organismi comunitari a tale proposito si deve dare seguito alle proposte della relatrice onorevole thors secondo cui la commissione dovrebbe includere nella relazione annuale sul diritto comunitario una sezione in cui si esaminino le petizioni e le denunce nonche elaborare un accordo interistituzionale che porti ad un trattamento pi rapido delle denunce
italian sviluppando il senso di queste proposte direi che in futuro il parlamento dovrebbe dedicare pi tempo a tali questioni che ai fini della valorizzazione del suo ruolo sono importanti tanto quanto il suo diritto di partecipare alla procedura di codecisione con il consiglio
italian pi in generale ormai tempo di affrontare la questione del controllo parlamentare in un modo nuovo
italian il secondo modo costituito dall adozione della carta europea dei diritti fondamentali con valore vincolante comprendente la tutela dei diritti per i cittadini europei che potranno presentare direttamente le proprie rivendicazioni si garantiranno cos non solo i diritti procedurali ma anche i diritti sostanziali che tuteleranno gli interessi dei cittadini in modo ragionevole e che comprenderanno anche il diritto al risarcimento nel caso in cui tali interessi vengano lesi
italian l eventualit gi ventilata di elaborare una carta che sia una semplice dichiarazione di intenti nuocerebbe indubbiamente alla credibilit dell unione la quale pur dichiarando che la trasparenza dell operato delle sue istituzioni costituisce il suo scopo fondamentale e che l avvicinamento al cittadino europeo un elemento essenziale per la sua integrazione evita di ammettere che questo strumento fondamentale imprescindibile per il conseguimento di detti obiettivi
italian la terza via rappresentata dal potenziamento e dal miglioramento del ruolo del mediatore specie agevolandone l accesso a tutti i documenti per rendere possibili le indagini
italian nel contempo gli interessanti contenuti della sua relazione dovrebbero essere oggetto di un attento studio e diventare il punto di partenza per le necessarie riforme del funzionamento delle istituzioni comunitarie
italian al mediatore auguro di avere coraggio e di proseguire nella sua opera
italian signor presidente innanzitutto un ringraziamento al mediatore europeo signor s derman alle due relatrici l onorevole lambert e l onorevole thors a tutti i colleghi della commissione per le petizioni e al segretariato
italian la nostra premessa costituita dalla convinzione che le istituzioni siano strumento al servizio dei cittadini e quindi la presunta violazione del diritto del cittadino crea una crisi di fiducia verso le istituzioni
italian oggi credo che abbiamo l esigenza della formazione di un contesto giuridico complesso complessivo armonico e funzionale quindi abbiamo anche l esigenza di creare degli strumenti giurisdizionali la carta dei diritti la formazione di un corpus juris che crei un diritto penale un diritto civile e un diritto amministrativo le procedure di accordo per il mutuo riconoscimento delle sentenze degli stati membri l europol e gli accordi settoriali la costituzione dell olaf come strumento di accertamento delle violazioni del diritto la probabile creazione dell istituzione di un procuratore europeo che dovrebbe essere l ufficio inquirente della corte di giustizia la distinzione tra l esercizio del potere inquirente e del potere giudicante la distinzione del profilo delle responsabilit penali civili e amministrative tutte cose queste strumenti che fanno progredire l unione europea
italian l accordo quadro di ieri una pietra miliare in questo senso
italian un altra cosa vorremmo chiedere in ultimo che la commissione per le petizioni possa dare come parlamento in codecisione l interpretazione autentica di alcune sue decisioni e poi la modifica dei trattati nel senso della razionalizzazione di tutto il sistema giuridico e giurisdizionale e degli strumenti in atto
italian signor presidente signor mediatore signora commissario onorevoli colleghi ringrazio le relatrici per il loro lavoro proficuo coscienzioso ed esauriente
italian il mediatore controlla e risolve le controversie tra l autorit e coloro che vi sono soggetti che l anno scorso sono state quasi duemila
italian
italian
italian
italian elencher sette principi quanto pi estesa un unione tanto maggiore l esigenza di apertura quanto pi recente tanto maggiore questa esigenza quanto pi complessa tanto maggiore il bisogno di trasparenza quanto pi informatizzata tanto pi aperta dev essere quanto pi istruita tanto pi dev essere pubblica quanto pi multiculturale tanto pi trasparente quanto pi democratica tanto pi aperta
italian siamo abituati a trovare istruzioni per l uso dappertutto e su tutti gli apparecchi persino sugli sbattitori da cucina i principi della buona amministrazione meritevolmente creati dal mediatore costituiscono le istruzioni per l uso nei confronti dell euroburocrazia
italian diciamo pure la verit queste istruzioni sono necessarie
italian non c democrazia senza buona amministrazione pertanto il trattato dell unione europea deve assolutamente contenere i principi della buona amministrazione
italian vi ancora un aspetto importante nella societ dell informazione la pubblicit dei documenti ufficiali e i principi relativi ad essi devono essere portati a un livello ad essa corrispondente con l aiuto delle nuove tecnologie in altre parole la denuncia si deve poter presentare tramite internet e anche gli atti precedenti e i relativi documenti devono essere disponibili in tempo reale
italian ritengo che abbiamo bisogno di una porta sulla rete per il mediatore
italian grazie per il lavoro svolto
italian signor presidente in veste di membro della commissione per le petizioni vorrei porgere le mie congratulazioni alla onorevole lambert per l ottima relazione e ringrazio la commissione europea per il prezioso contributo all esame delle petizioni che riceviamo
italian la petizione un diritto riconosciuto ai cittadini europei e ai residenti dell unione che consente loro di far valere i diritti garantiti dai trattati
italian tuttavia pochi cittadini sono consapevoli di poter presentare una petizione
italian dai dossier che trattiamo si evince peraltro una scarsa conoscenza dei diritti conferiti dalla cittadinanza europea cosa che si traduc purtropp in un percento di petizioni irricevibili
italian le petizioni ricevibili si riferiscono in particolare a problemi a livello di libert di circolazione di stabilimento di prestazioni di servizi di prestazioni sociali di riconoscimento dei diplomi e delle qualifiche nonche a problemi fiscali
italian si assiste inoltre ad un aumento delle petizioni collettive che vertono su temi legati all ambiente ed probabile che con l ampliamento delle competenze dell unione crescer il numero di tali petizioni e degli ambiti trattati
italian per soddisfare le aspettative dei cittadini occorre una buona coesione tra commissione per le petizioni istituzioni europee e amministrazioni nazionali
italian e altres necessario che le altre commissioni parlamentari tengano maggiormente conto del lavoro della nostra commissione
italian il corretto esame delle petizioni risente della cronica assenza del consiglio alle riunioni
italian le amministrazioni nazionali sono infatti le prime ad applicare il diritto comunitario ed pertanto indispensabile che esse lavorino in linea con le istituzioni europee in particolar modo parlamento e commissione
italian la commissione per le petizioni deve attendere tropp a volte perfino molti ann le risposte delle amministrazioni nazionali
italian siamo pienamente consapevoli dell entit del compito e delle difficolt da superare
italian e innegabile la mancanza di notoriet della commissione per le petizioni il cui lavoro indispensabile per rafforzare il legame tra cittadini ed unione europea
italian si devono inoltre consolidare le strutture e gli strumenti di tale commissione per migliorare la sua efficacia e sarebbe auspicabile stabilire relazioni pi strette con le commissioni per le petizioni dei parlamenti nazionali
italian infine un europa pi vicina ai cittadini costituisce uno dei punti di forza del programma della presidenza francese
italian il lavoro della nostra commissione rientra in tale quadro sta a noi tradurre in pratica questa aspettativa
italian signor presidente questa mattina vorrei porgere il benvenuto al signor s derman e congratularmi con le onorevoli lambert e thors per le relazioni che hanno presentato
italian la situazione della nostra societ tale per cui se governi e autorit potessero fare a modo loro farebbero volentieri a meno delle commissioni per le petizioni e dei mediatori per natura infatti tendono ad essere piuttosto reticenti
italian le suddette commissioni e i mediatori esistono soltanto perche i cittadini e i loro pubblici rappresentanti li richiedono e si ergono in loro difesa quando ci sono di conseguenza importante che continuiamo a chiedere risorse adeguate sia per la commissione per le petizioni che per l ufficio del mediatore
italian negando loro tali risorse infatti ne limiteremmo l efficacia
italian e una vergogna che il parlamento riservi un simile trattamento alla commissione per le petizioni il collegamento diretto pi importante di cui dispongono i cittadini con questa istituzione e con le altre istituzioni dell unione europea
italian la commissione manca di un adeguato servizio di segreteria e viene trattata in maniera abominevole per quanto riguarda le traduzioni che sono in fondo alla lista
italian e un trattamento palesemente insufficiente
italian inviterei i rappresentanti della commissione e del consigli se fossero qui ma essi ignorano la commissione per le petizioni come pure il parlamento chiederei loro di fornire le risorse necessarie a questi organismi per espletare il loro compito
italian la commissione per le petizioni in modo particolare un importante meccanismo d accesso per i popoli d europa ed quindi essenziale garantire che essa possa svolgere la propria opera in maniera efficace
italian le due questioni pi importanti di cui si occupa la commissione per le petizioni sono il riconoscimento dei titoli di studio perche un cittadino possa lavorare in altri stati membri e l impatto ambientale dello sviluppo edilizio
italian in particolare vi un diffuso timore che gli studi di impatto ambientale previsti dalla normativa comunitaria vengano trattati come qualcosa di scarso valore infatti vengono ignorati o comunque non vengono affrontati i problemi reali
italian signor presidente desidero congratularmi con jacob s derman per l ottimo lavoro svolto che ha condotto alla sua rielezione il ottobre dello scorso anno
italian al contempo desidero elogiare il mediatore europeo per la sua relazione annuale esemplare per chiarezza e completezza
italian dalla relazione emerge che la commissione il principale oggetto delle indagini svolte quasi nel percento dei casi
italian certo viene sottolineato come ci dipenda soprattutto dal fatto che la commissione l istituzione che prende il maggior numero di decisioni suscettibili di un impatto diretto sul cittadino
italian nell esposizione sulle singole denunce emerge comunque un insufficiente grado di trasparenza
italian la mancanza o il rifiuto di informazioni hanno rappresentato infatti la principale causa delle denunce
italian la trasparenza importante per garantire al cittadino una maggiore possibilit di incidere sul funzionamento dell unione e per contrastare ogni tendenza alla corruzione alla frode e alle irregolarit
italian desidero far presente che nella relazione viene ribadito che tutte le istituzioni e gli organismi dell unione dovranno dotarsi di un codice di buona condotta amministrativa
italian esiste tuttavia il rischio cui accenna la relazione del mediatore che detto codice possa ricevere contenuti molto diversi a seconda delle istituzioni e degli organismi
italian l aspetto delle pubbliche relazioni nell attivit del mediatore gi trattato da altri oratori non pu in alcun caso essere sottovalutato
italian desidero concludere il mio intervento con alcune domande quali conseguenze avr una carta dei diritti fondamentali sul lavoro del mediatore
italian vi sono risorse a sufficienza per assicurare un lavoro eseguito correttamente
italian quali sono le principali ragioni delle mancanze delle varie istituzioni nei loro rapporti con i cittadini
italian e la volont che manca sono le risorse a essere insufficienti oppure esiste una burocrazia che impedisce e intralcia l evasione delle pratiche
italian signor presidente in base alla relazione del mediatore e alla relazione thors si pu constatare che l istituzione del mediatore ha rinsaldato la sua posizione
italian la commissione apprezza l attivit svolta da jacob s derman e anche i cittadini hanno scoperto l esistenza del mediatore
italian i pilastri del lavoro del mediatore sono l indipendenza e l apertura giusto sottolineare il significato della buona amministrazione per i cittadini e per l autorit dell unione europea agli occhi dei cittadini ed bene che la commissione sostenga gli sforzi del mediatore nell applicare le regole della buona amministrazione
italian il principio della buona amministrazione sta per essere adottato anche nella carta dei diritti fondamentali in corso di preparazione
italian dalla relazione si evince che solo circa il percento delle petizioni indirizzate al mediatore ricade nella sua sfera di competenza pertanto si deve ulteriormente rinsaldare la cooperazione tra il mediatore europeo e i suoi omologhi nazionali e locali
italian signor presidente onorevoli colleghi per me motivo di soddisfazione prendere parte al dibattito di oggi insieme al mediatore europeo s derman la cui opera al servizio dei cittadini dell unione davvero importante e molto apprezzata dalla commissione
italian la commissione consapevole che il cittadino dev essere sempre al centro delle nostre preoccupazioni perche il cittadino il destinatario di tutte le nostre attivit e la giustificazione della nostra ragione d essere
italian in questo senso sia la commissione per le petizioni che il mediatore europeo svolgono un compito fondamental a livelli diversi con effetti divers ed essenziale per il miglioramento del funzionamento delle istituzioni
italian la commissione per le petizioni si occupa delle preoccupazioni concrete dei cittadini e come sottolinea la onorevole lambert con la quale mi congratulo sinceramente per la relazione le petizioni presentate al parlamento illustrano i problemi incontrati dai cittadini nei rapporti con le amministrazioni europee e spesso anche nazionali mettendo in rilievo allo stesso tempo le lacune legislative che esistono a livello sia europeo sia nazionale
italian il mediatore europeo come afferma la onorevole thors che colgo l occasione per ringraziare per la relazione si occupa delle denunce contro le istituzioni e gli organismi dell unione europea per inadempienze amministrative egli ci sprona a migliorare la gestione e la qualit dei servizi segnalandoci i punti deboli che necessitano di miglioramenti e di maggiore attenzione
italian tuttavia i primi a volere un amministrazione pi efficace e trasparente siamo proprio noi i responsabili di questa amministrazione e in tal senso sono benvenute le critiche rivolte ai nostri difetti
italian infatti soltanto conoscendo i difetti possibile porvi rimedio
italian e per questo insisto che per il buon funzionamento delle istituzioni attribuiamo grande importanza al lavoro svolto sia dal mediatore europeo sia dalla commissione per le petizioni
italian in riferimento alla relazione della onorevole lambert vorrei affrontare due aspetti concreti
italian uno riguardante la cooperazione tra istituzioni indispensabile per migliorare il funzionamento della commissione per le petizioni e la sua capacit d azione
italian vorrei esprimere la mia soddisfazione perche la relazione sottolinea il ruolo costruttivo svolto dalla commissione al momento di esaminare le petizioni e perche lo considera complessivamente soddisfacente
italian essa ci d una specie di approvazione di cui siamo grati ma cercheremo di migliorare
italian questo non altro che un incentivo per arrivare ad un maggior impegno un miglior lavoro e una maggiore collaborazione
italian in secondo luogo la relazione propone una revisione delle procedure d esame della commissione per le petizioni
italian ebbene desidero dire che mi sembra magnifica l idea di raggruppare l esame delle petizioni per argomento affidare a relatori specializzati il compito di esaminare tali petizioni nel dettaglio ed eventualmente di trarre conclusioni che consentano di correggere i difetti di prendere decisioni per risolvere eventuali lacune dei testi legislativi o di contrastare effetti indesiderati di tali testi
italian allo stesso modo la commissione disposta a prendere in considerazione la revisione dell accordo interistituzionale con il parlamento e il consiglio sulla presentazione delle petizioni che modifichi quello in vigore risalente al soprattutto in un ambito che ritengo fondamentale e che stato segnalato da alcuni oratori ovvero il problema dei tempi di risposta
italian e vero che a volte le nostre risposte si fanno attendere a lungo
italian non sempre la colpa va attribuita alla commissione a volte dipendiamo dalle risposte delle amministrazioni nazionali tuttavia vero che in questo ambito dobbiamo fare uno sforzo per migliorare e per poter contribuire in maniera ancora pi soddisfacente al lavoro della commissione
italian desidero sottolineare l importanza della collaborazione con altre amministrazioni collaborazione che vorremmo migliorare il pi possibile
italian la commissione aperta al dialogo sia con il parlamento che con il consiglio per migliorare i tempi di risposta ed accrescere la trasparenza e la comunicazione con il parlamento e la commissione per le petizioni
italian riguardo alla relazione thors posso dire che concordiamo sulla necessit di consolidare l indipendenza del mediatore europeo come istituzione e di sostenere la sua opera a favore della trasparenza e dell apertura
italian riteniamo che il principio della motivazione delle decisioni che riguardano i cittadini sia essenziale e cerchiamo di applicarlo in maniera sistematica
italian inoltre desidero aggiungere che accettiamo la definizione secondo cui si ha una cattiva amministrazione quando un organismo pubblico non agisce conformemente ad una regola o a un principio a cui vincolato
italian vorrei tuttavia dire che come ha sottolineato assai bene jacob s derman il mediatore europeo un organo non giudiziario e pertanto non pu mai sostituirsi agli organi giudiziari
italian i suoi compiti sono diversi da quelli dei tribunali
italian ritengo che sia importantissimo nelle relazioni che si sviluppano tra commissione mediatore europeo e altre istituzioni od organi rispettare sistematicamente l equilibrio istituzionale definito nei trattati
italian e vero che la realt ogni giorno pi importante dell istituzione del mediatore europeo che un istituzione pi giovane per alcuni aspetti rispetto ad altre della struttura europea richiede un certo tempo di maturazione affinche i cittadini possano conoscerla
italian il mediatore europeo nella sua relazione ha riferito che stato registrato un forte aumento delle denunce e delle indagini nel corso di quest ultimo anno e ci va attribuito ad una maggiore conoscenza dell istituzione da parte dei cittadini
italian e necessario un periodo di maturazione nei rapporti tra il mediatore europeo e le altre istituzioni allo scopo di stabilire gli equilibri desiderati e risolvere le tensioni logiche che possono esistere finche le cose non si avviino
italian devo dire per che finora la collaborazione tra commissione e l istituzione del mediatore europeo e della persona che lo rappresenta jacob s derman stata magnifica
italian onorevoli deputati vorrei sottolineare brevemente la positivit di queste istituzioni in quanto qualsiasi azione da parte di un amministrazione pu in un determinato momento mancare di trasparenza e di efficacia pu violare diritti fondamentali o persino macchiarsi di corruzione
italian tuttavia vorrei dire che non possibile additare l amministrazione comunitaria come particolarmente affetta da questi difetti
italian se la paragonassimo ad altre amministrazioni ritengo che sosterrebbe assai bene il confronto e che meriterebbe addirittura un bel voto
italian da ultimo desidero rinnovare le mie congratulazioni al mediatore europeo s derman per l attivit svolta per il consistente aumento dei suoi interventi e del suo lavoro per la sua collaborazione a volte critica tuttavia questa la sua opera e la sua funzione e noi della commissione cos la interpretiamo
italian l elaborazione di un codice di condotta applicabile ai rapporti dei funzionari comunitari con i cittadini una priorit ed in questo senso che stanno lavorando il commissario kinnock e la commissione in generale
italian riguardo alle modifiche dello statuto del mediatore europeo la commissione competente che al momento opportuno deve emettere un parere in conformit all articolo del trattato e quando il parlamento prender l iniziativa analizzeremo tutte le questioni pertinenti
italian onorevoli deputati rinnovo ancora una volta le mie congratulazioni alle due relatrici e colgo l occasione per esprimere la mia gratitudine al mediatore europeo s derman per l ottimo lavoro svolto dalla sua posizione di indipendenza e dal rigore del suo incarico
italian mediatore en signor presidente la ringrazio per avermi dato la parola ho cos la possibilit di rispondere alle domande che sono state poste
italian la domanda dell onorevole turco riguardava il diritto di presentare denunce utilizzando la posta elettronica l ufficio del mediatore europeo riconosce questa prassi ormai da qualche anno poiche l onorevole dell alba ci ha convinto dell importanza di questa opportunit
italian attualmente circa il percento delle denunce che riceviamo giungono per posta elettronica se consultate il nostro sito troverete un modulo che pu essere inviato direttamente per posta elettronica
italian l onorevole paasilinna ha parlato della possibilit di sviluppare il sito in tale direzione abbiamo gi accesso diretto a tutti i siti dei mediatori regionali o nazionali ma ovviamente tutto ci suscettibile di ulteriori sviluppi
italian la onorevole raschhofer ha ricordato la proposta di regolamento sull accesso pubblico ai documenti una questione che stata oggetto di dibattito vorrei sottolineare che attualmente il documento in discussione al parlamento
italian il lavoro della commissione pu cominciare
italian nei colloqui che ho avuto con il presidente prodi egli mi ha detto che disposto a guardare con favore a tutte le proposte ragionevoli volte a migliorare tale regolamento che come ho detto viene discusso in parlamento
italian la onorevole malmstr m ci ha informato che alcuni stati membri ignorano l esistenza dell ufficio del mediatore purtroppo se ci facessimo troppa pubblicit riceveremmo molte denunce che esulano dal nostro mandato
italian cerchiamo quindi d individuare quei cittadini che hanno problemi con le autorit e le cui denunce sono motivate
italian i deputati del parlamento rappresentano un importante fonte di informazione per molti cittadini sarei lieto se voleste collaborare con noi per far conoscere ai cittadini la possibilit di presentare petizioni e denunce
italian grazie signor s derman

italian signor presidente ci riuniamo quando ormai la congestione dello spazio aereo ha raggiunto livelli senza precedenti
italian secondo le statistiche la percentuale dei ritardi di minuti aumentata dal percento del al percento del e continua a crescere
italian non siamo preoccupati soltanto per gli effetti della congestione in termini di disagi e di implicazioni per la stabilit economica della nostra unione quello che ci preoccupa pi di ogni altra cosa che essa potrebbe pregiudicare la sicurezza
italian la carenza di controllori del traffico aereo una realt ed una realt la carenza di investimenti nei sistemi di controllo del traffico aereo
italian la domanda in materia di trasporto aereo cresce quasi giornalmente a causa del basso costo dei biglietti del desiderio della gente di andare all estero in vacanza o per affari e della possibilit di concedersi una pausa di qualche giorno senza doverci pensare troppo tutto questo aumenta la pressione sul traffico aereo e perci dobbiamo congratularci con coloro che lavorano nel settore e ringraziarli per quanto hanno fatto finora
italian purtroppo essi non riescon e ci non dipende soltanto da loro a reggere la pressione nel migliore dei modi abbiamo potuto sperimentarlo di recente in seguito ai ritardi provocati dallo sciopero che ha interessato la francia
italian tutto ci ha avuto un effetto deleterio sulla mobilit dei nostri cittadini anche in relazione ai costi economici finanziari e sociali sostenuti dalle nostre imprese e da diverse categorie colpite giornalmente da questi eventi
italian vorrei congratularmi con il commissario signora de palacio per aver sottoposto la questione alla nostra commissione in questi termini per la forza e il vigore che essa ha mostrato inizialmente nell istituire il gruppo ad alto livello e per la decisione con cui ha affrontato il problema
italian la commissione ha quindi contribuito in maniera sostanziale ad affrontare il problema della saturazione dello spazio aereo
italian il consiglio trasporti deve adottare una decisione politica per affrontare il problema non possiamo rimandarla necessario pensarci subito
italian abbiamo bisogno di un cielo unico che sovrasti il mercato unico ma si deve riconoscere che i singoli stati hanno una propria opinione sul modo di affrontare tale questione soprattutto nella misura in cui essa influisce sul mantenimento della forza lavoro e per quanto riguarda l uso dello spazio aereo nazionale a scopi militari
italian lo spazio aereo militare e le violazioni che vi sono connesse in alcuni paesi sono un altro punto che dobbiamo affrontare per quanto concerne non solo lo spazio occupato dall aviazione militare ma anche le violazioni dei corridoi aerei civili da parte dall aviazione militare che non rispetta le prassi del trasporto aereo civile
italian anche questo un aspetto di cui dobbiamo occuparci
italian nella relazione ho propost e la commissione si in linea generale dichiarata d accord che eurocontrol diventi un autorit preposta alla regolamentazione fornita di maggiori poteri capace di imporre sanzioni pi efficaci e che i diretti interessati possano rivolgersi ad essa
italian d altra parte crediamo che l offerta di servizi nel settore del traffico aereo debba essere aperta alla liberalizzazione e soggetta alle decisioni dei singoli stati
italian i deputati sanno bene che nel regno unito abbiamo affrontato la questione introducendo il principio della privatizzazione ci pu andar bene per noi ma non necessariamente la soluzione pi opportuna per tutti
italian sta ai singoli stati decidere essi per devono affrontare il problema della divisione tra regolamentazione del proprio spazio aereo e gestione dei servizi aerei che potrebbe essere offerta da una o pi organizzazioni
italian siamo convinti che sia necessario fornire criteri obiettivi e indipendenti per la gestione del sistema riteniamo ugualmente indispensabile offrire incentivi a coloro che a tali criteri si adeguano imponendo invece sanzioni a coloro che non soddisfano gli standard auspicati
italian stimiamo opportuno compensare i passeggeri per i ritardi ingiustificati e crediamo che i loro diritti in questi casi dovrebbero essere chiari e conosciuti
italian soprattutto desideriamo che il commissario signora de palacio faccia pression col nostro appoggi sul consiglio e sugli altri organismi ad esso associati affinche adottino decisioni con urgenza
italian se c una critica generale che stata mossa alla relazione da parte dell industria che forse essa poco audace o si muove troppo lentamente
italian non si pu continuare cos giunto il momento di affrontare la questione
italian signor presidente se me lo consente vorrei esporre brevemente alcune osservazioni in merito alla relazione in esame
italian e evidente che l organizzazione del controllo aereo nei cieli europei dev essere totalmente rivista
italian in tal senso l iniziativa della commissione encomiabile
italian tuttavia anche se non si pu negare che essa debba essere ripensata e che tutto vada chiarito ritengo che si debba diffidare di alcune delle idee esposte nelle relazioni nelle comunicazioni e negli interventi sul tema
italian e altrettanto evidente che la frammentazione politica del cielo europeo non corrisponde pi alle esigenze tecniche e di mercato
italian e con grande sorpresa che ho appreso che nell europa d oggi sono ancora essenzialmente le frontiere politiche a prevalere in materia di organizzazione del controllo aereo
italian si deve creare uno spazio europeo del controllo aereo tuttavia tale spazio va totalmente unificato
italian in base a quali criteri le conclusioni della relazione suscitano molteplici interrogativi
italian a mio avviso ovvio che il frazionamento del controllo aereo comporti alcuni vantaggi il controllo aereo presuppone infatti una suddivisione del territorio ed i limiti di sicurezza tecnic cos come i limiti uman presuppongono che ciascun controllore e ciascuna postazione di controllo abbiano un territorio limitato ed un numero limitato di voli da seguire
italian in tal senso l organizzazione a maglie del territorio europeo deve essere mantenuta e in un certo senso ampliata
italian sono pertanto favorevole ad aumentare i centri di controllo purche non si parli di unificazione dell intero controllo bens di unificazione del sistema giuridico e di unificazione tecnologica poiche la relazione e l istruzione di tale relazione hanno evidenziato la mancanza di una volont europea
italian il presidente toglie la parola all oratore
italian signor presidente signora vicepresidente onorevoli colleghi desidero innanzi tutto ringraziare sentitamente l onorevole atkins per l eccellente relazione che ha preparato
italian egli si impegnato a fondo non solo per commentare le proposte della commissione ma anche per indicare le linee da seguire
italian ritengo che sia giusto fare una netta distinzione tra la funzione regolamentatrice e quella operativa e ai punti e ribadiamo che noi come parlamento abbiamo deciso gi due volte che la funzione regolamentatrice dev essere demandata all unione europea
italian mi riallaccio cos alle argomentazioni formulate dal precedente oratore
italian e ovvio che occorre distinguere e specificare che nel settore operativo ci possono essere diverse o anche molte societ di servizi la funzione regolamentatrice per deve restare di competenza dell unione europea o piuttosto deve diventarlo
italian ma questo non un problema
italian l unione europea conta oggi quindici stati membri mentre altri dodici hanno chiesto di aderirvi
italian se si procede sin d ora in base al sistema dello spazio economico europeo fissando le regole comuni e poi interpellando i paesi candidati questi ultimi possono essere integrati
italian anche alla luce di ci reputo giusto l approccio in base al quale la commissione europea stante l attuale situazione relativamente alla funzione regolamentatrice debba riunire sotto eurocontrol gli interessi di tutti gli stati membri
italian per quanto concerne la funzione regolamentatrice abbiamo bisogno non di frammentazione ma di unit
italian rivolgo un pressante invito alla signora commissario affinche sottoponga nuovamente al gruppo di lavoro le proposte su cui il parlamento deliberer oggi e la sollecito a proseguire nel suo impegno per condurre il gruppo di lavoro a risultati validi e concreti
italian nutriamo grande stima per la vicepresidente della commissione cui si deve l istituzione di questo gruppo composto da esperti civili e militari che lavora alacremente nonostante il persistere di qualche resistenza da parte di alcuni paesi
italian formuliamo i nostri migliori auguri alla vicepresidente nell auspicio che in ottobre possiamo disporre di un programma eccellente
italian signor presidente a nome del gruppo pse vorrei innanzitutto compiacermi per l iniziativa della signora commissario di cui condividiamo gli obiettivi e sosteniamo le finalit
italian lamentiamo per la mancanza di integrazione con le altre iniziative che ella persegue come risulta evidente dalla sua comunicazione
italian notiamo inoltre la mancanza di volont politica in seno sia della commissione sia del consiglio sebbene valga la pena di ricordare che l iniziativa stata avviata nel giugno dello scorso anno dal consiglio che ha chiesto al commissario di presentare la comunicazione in esame
italian in effetti nel marzo di quest anno il consiglio di lisbona ha cercato di fare dei progressi progressi che sono certo noi tutti auspichiamo
italian inoltre il gruppo pse sostiene e condivide la posizione del relatore che ci appare assai ponderata e con cui si materializza la sussidiariet a livello europeo se necessario a livello nazionale se possibile
italian vorrei quindi ringraziarlo per aver tenuto conto di molte delle nostre preoccupazioni soprattutto nel settore della sicurezza che nella relazione rappresenta la priorit fondamentale
italian la principale preoccupazione del gruppo pse riguarda il mancato approfondimento della causa dei ritardi del traffico aereo lo sviluppo incontrollato della capacit degli aeroporti la programmazione delle compagnie aeree il comportamento dei passeggeri le infrastrutture aeroportuali e la carenza di controllori ricordata dal relatore
italian ci sta poi molto a cuore un principio fondamentale che sosteniamo e che dev essere ulteriormente sviluppato quello della separazione dell attivit di regolamentazione da quella dei prestatori di servizi
italian questo dev essere un elemento chiave del nostro nuovo approccio
italian anche eurocontrol dev essere riformato rinnovato e rilanciato
italian il terzo principio che noi sosteniamo la liberalizzazione ma non la privatizzazione infine vogliamo che queste proposte vengano sviluppate insieme alla autorit europea per la sicurezza aerea di cui stata proposta la creazione
italian infatti la sicurezza dev essere per noi una norma guida e sono certo che diverr il nostro principio ispiratore nei mesi a venire
italian tra il e il il traffico aereo in europa raddoppiato e raddoppier ancora nei prossimi dieci anni dobbiamo affrontare la questione con urgenza ma in maniera coerente
italian ci che oggi gradiremmo sentire dalla signora commissario un programma che definisca i tempi di attuazione per i mesi futuri
italian sappiamo tutti che quest estate le sale d aspetto degli aeroporti saranno affollate di persone che chiederanno perche il loro volo in ritardo non di pochi minuti ma di ore
italian spero che oggi la signora commissario possa presentarci un programma che ci dica quando questi ritardi cesseranno
italian attendo con impazienza i suoi commenti e soprattutto mi auguro che informi il parlamento sulle conclusioni raggiunte la settimana scorsa dal consiglio che ha ricevuto la relazione interinale del gruppo ad alto livello
italian sollecito i colleghi ad approvare la proposta del relatore ed esorto la signora commissario a presentare un programma ben definito
italian signor presidente signora commissario onorevoli colleghi penso che l onorevole atkins abbia elaborato un ottima relazione nella quale indica con chiarezza la direzione che dobbiamo prendere in quanto ci troviamo in una situazione paradossale in cui abbiamo un mercato unico per il trasporto aereo ma abbiamo un cielo diviso in maniera del tutto assurda
italian abbiamo gi avuto modo di sentire alcuni colleghi che hanno descritto le conseguenze di tale paradosso
italian se vogliamo uno spazio aereo unico dobbiamo fare degli investimenti come sottolineato nella relazione
italian mancano migliaia di persone e occorre investire in infrastrutture tecniche
italian pertanto evidente che bisogna reperire i fondi necessari
italian ci significa anch e penso che si tratti di un punto ancor pi difficil che si devono adottare con grande rapidit decisioni politiche che possono puntare in un unica direzione
italian noi dobbiamo affrontare la questione a livello europeo
italian siamo tutti concordi nel ritenere che gli stati membri debbano finalmente decidere che cosa fare
italian anche i servizi nazionali devono capire che hanno fatto il loro tempo che dobbiamo avere un servizio europeo e non pi nazionale perche questa la causa di tutti i mali se cos posso dire
italian naturalmente i servizi devono occupare una posizione di primo piano perche il controllo del trasporto aereo non un settore a se ma rappresenta un servizio offerto ad una compagnia aerea e ai suoi clienti
italian talvolta lo si dimentica e si pensa ad una cerchia ristretta di persone
italian quando parliamo di servizi su un mercato unico ci implica la fine dei monopoli e significa che dobbiamo disporre di una normativa europea chiara senza monopoli nel campo dei servizi
italian siamo tutti d accordo su questo punto e mi auguro che potremo procedere a grandi passi
italian un aspetto importante sul quale ha gi richiamato l attenzione l onorevole watts costituito dalla sicurezza a tale proposito non si pu fare alcune concessione
italian signora commissario il punto essenzial e penso che anche lei lo riconosca senza problem che quando in ottobre il gruppo ad alto livello pubblicher le sue conclusioni lei presenti quanto prima delle proposte che successivamente tutti esercitino delle pressioni sul consiglio che gli stati membri adottino le decisioni che devono adottare e che queste si muovano nella direzione da noi gi indicata alcune volte in seno al parlamento europeo e che ora stata ribadita nella relazione dell onorevole atkins
italian signor presidente la relazione si occupa del problema dell aumento del traffico aereo vorrei concentrarmi soltanto su un aspetto della relazione o meglio su un importante omissione
italian la relazione avanza alcune proposte ma a mio avviso il problema principale sta nel suo principio ispiratore secondo il quale si pu risolvere la congestione liberalizzando il sistema di controllo e la gestione del traffico aereo
italian le opzioni che ci vengono offerte si concentrano su aspetti tecnici piuttosto che sulle tendenze fondamentali
italian indubbiamente un cielo unico europeo renderebbe pi efficiente l utilizzo dello spazio aereo europeo e migliorando la gestione del traffico aereo aumenterebbe lo spazio disponibile
italian anche la limitazione dello spazio aereo utilizzato dai trasporti militari sarebbe un intervento significativo
italian nessuna di queste soluzioni tecniche potr influire significativamente nel lungo periodo se non affronteremo prima il problema fondamentale la crescita insostenibile del traffico aereo
italian la relazione non riesce a collegare il problema della congestione con la riduzione del traffico aereo non accenna ad una strategia vitale
italian e come se cercassimo di arrestare un allagamento cambiando posizione ai secchi sotto il rubinetto senza considerare la possibilit di girare il rubinetto per ridurre il flusso d acqua
italian consideriamo i fatti
italian la recente relazione della commissione ci ha gi informato che la crescita del settore aereo insostenibile e dev essere arrestata e che nei prossimi anni si prevede il raddoppiamento del traffico aereo
italian ci provocher gravi problemi di congestione ma anche ambientali legati non solo al rumore e l inquinamento che affliggono i residenti delle zone vicine agli aeroporti ma anche all impatto sul clima
italian a livello mondiale il trasporto aereo gi la fonte di emissioni di gas a effetto serra in pi rapida crescita ed entro il potrebbe ammontare al percento
italian purtroppo la relazione non individua il collegamento vitale fra riduzione della congestione e del traffico aereo e si lascia quindi sfuggire una grande occasione per dare a questi problemi una risposta a lungo termine
italian signor presidente signora commissario ritengo che l espressione cielo unico europeo sia ambigua poiche risaputo che il controllo aereo gi di fatto un ambito d attivit europeo
italian esiste un controllo europeo dello spazio aereo con eurocontrol ed esiste un ente preposto il central flow management unit con sede a bruxelles
italian il sistema non perfetto vero tuttavia esiste
italian si deve pertanto migliorare la situazione a partire dall ovvia constatazione che i ritardi si sono accentuati e che dato che il traffico tende a crescere essi aumenteranno ancor di pi
italian e ampiamente riconosciuto che i ritardi sono imputabili a molteplici cause tuttavia ritengo che ci si trovi di fronte ad un offensiva tesa a presentare il controllo aereo come l unico responsabile dei ritardi
italian sarebbe opportuno credo considerare anche molto di pi i problemi riconducibili ai diversi tipi di aerei alle tipologie dei flussi degli scali e delle rotazioni nonche i problemi che sussistono sul versante della difesa
italian ho l impressione che ci si lanci in una fuga in avanti con soluzioni in apparenza ovvie che per non tengono conto della specificit del controllo aereo
italian l onorevole zimeray lo diceva poc anzi il tragitto di un aereo frazionato in spazi e quanto pi il traffico denso tante pi sono le divisioni in spazi
italian la divisione in spazi corrisponde infatti alla capacit umana di controllare di gestire un determinato numero di aerei
italian pertanto ritenere che vi sia un eccessivo numero di centri di controllo a mio avviso un assurdit
italian perche non sostenere allora che ci sono troppi aerei
italian non vi sono neanche che io sappia posti di blocco del controllo aereo specifici alle zone di frontiera
italian la grande proposta che ci viene presentata per migliorare il traffico consiste nel separare le funzioni di regolamentazione e di controllo
italian tuttavia qual l interesse di tale misura
italian la necessit di riflettere su frazionamenti pi appropriati plausibile ma non questo il contenuto della proposta
italian la separazione delle funzioni condurrebbe alla liberalizzazione della fornitura dei servizi del traffico aereo e alla creazione come dice la relazione dell onorevole atkins di un mercato interno liberalizzato
italian parlare di controllo aereo non equivale a parlare di una compagnia aerea ne di un settore commerciale
italian la sua principale funzione non va dimenticato di garantire la sicurezza
italian credo pertanto che sia contrario alla sicurezza sottoporre gli organismi di controllo o di certificazione degli aerei alla pressione dei mercati
italian va dunque preservata la capacit d investire in nuovi strumenti tecnologici e nella formazione
italian in franci e non pretendo di farne un modell esiste una direzione generale che gestisce tutto e nel corso degli ultimi anni ci sono stati investimenti nonche assunzioni di controllori di volo
italian il sistema funziona
italian in nome di cosa si vuole spezzare
italian il presidente toglie la parola all oratore
italian signor presidente la presente relazione parte da una constatazione ovvia seppure molto sentita da noi parlamentari europei che utilizziamo di frequente l aereo come mezzo di trasporto quella che il cielo sempre pi congestionato a causa della crescente domanda
italian a questo eccesso di aerei corrisponde inevitabilmente un aumento dei ritardi con i conseguenti danni per i passeggeri le imprese le attivit commerciali e il turismo
italian come ha asserito il relatore pensiamo che il trasporto aereo vada considerato un sistema organico a cui fanno capo gli operatori gli aeroporti e i servizi di sicurezza aerea i cui elementi sono direttamente interdipendenti e pertanto riteniamo che l unico modo per risolvere i problemi di capacit dello spazio aereo consista nell avviare un analisi globale
italian ecco perche accogliamo con favore la creazione del gruppo ad alto livello composto da rappresentanti civili e militari e presieduto dalla signora commissario de palacio che si occuper di studiare la questione dei ritardi aerei al fine di ridurre al minimo i problemi causati dal trasporto aereo e che dovr presentare in merito una relazione al consiglio
italian da parte nostra speriamo che la relazione si concentri sull elaborazione di proposte fattibili e di soluzioni concrete realistiche ed efficaci per una soluzione del problema dei ritardi aerei in europa e ci auguriamo che non vengano presi in considerazione i suggerimenti polemici che contribuiscono poco o niente a tale obiettivo come ad esempio nel caso della difesa della libera concorrenza tra prestatori di servizi di gestione del traffico aereo
italian non vediamo infatti quale sia il nesso tra questa pretesa liberalizzazione e la questione dei ritardi che occorre risolvere con urgenza
italian d altro canto siamo d accordo con il fatto che le soluzioni proposte devono essere prese nel rispetto della sovranit nazionale degli stati membri limitando l accentramento dell attivit normativa alle materie strettamente necessarie esse devono inoltre tutelare le esigenze particolari legati alla difesa e alle necessit militari specifiche di ciascuno stato nonche rispettare gli impegni sottoscritti da tutti in seno alle organizzazioni internazionali
italian ci non significa che gli stati non siano tenuti a rendere il pi flessibile possibile il transito degli aerei nello spazio aereo superiore e a trovare formule di coordinamento pi efficaci con le necessit operative di natura militare
italian anche il programma di gestione aerea europea che mira ad ottenere il coordinamento e l integrazione completa dei sistemi atm su scala europea dev essere approfondito nell ambito di eurocontrol visto che il problema non risiede tanto nella divisione dello spazio aereo che pu essere giustificabile dal punto di vista dell adeguamento del numero di aerei e di rotte sotto la responsabilit di ogni controllore quanto nell armonizzazione tecnica dei sistemi atm
italian signor presidente la relazione pregevole affronta un tema veramente delicato e direi estremamente tecnico ma il problema essenzialmente politico
italian e giusto allora auspicare un unico controllo del traffico aereo quanto meno per tutta l unione europea ovviamente includendo anche per ragioni tecniche la confederazione elvetica
italian questo il punto fondamentale e questo permetter di risolvere molti problemi unitamente allo sviluppo della tecnica e qui penso ai sistemi tcas ai sistemi gps ai sistemi gnns che ovviamente favoriscono una pi fluida scorrevolezza del traffico aereo
italian vorrei concludere con qualche perplessit riguardo al principio di sussidiariet un principio fondamentale per non sempre facile
italian proprio le regole del trasporto aereo del traffico aereo sono forse le regole pi internazionali che esistano insieme a quelle della navigazione marittima e quindi difficile poi scendere nei particolari
italian un ultima cosa vedo che la relazione punta soprattutto sui grandi vettori aerei le compagnie aeree
italian non dimentichiamo che esistono altri utilizzatori dello spazio aereo gli aerotaxi le compagnie private e anche gli utenti privati degli aerei degli aeroclub
italian signor presidente signora commissario bisogna fare molta fatica per conquistarsi un posticino sul mercato dei trasporti di sicuro se vi un aspra concorrenza se vi un grande affollamento se vi sono organizzazioni di cooperazione a livello mondiale e se vi sono considerevoli voci di spese esterne
italian questa la situazione in cui versa il settore del trasporto aereo
italian pertanto dobbiamo riflettere sul futuro del settore
italian a mio giudizio non possiamo accettare come un dato di fatto una crescita illimitata
italian e vero che determinati flussi di trasporto non possono essere espletati in altro modo se non per via aerea ma ci non riguarda la stragrande maggioranza dei casi
italian la nostra politica si deve orientare su tale constatazione il che richiede un approccio di ampio respiro e investimenti mirati ed efficaci in modi di trasporto alternativi
italian non siamo per ancora giunti a questo punto lo sviluppo delle reti transeuropee vive fasi altalenanti
italian e indispensabile ricercare soluzioni alternative a breve termine
italian mi sembra soprattutto essenziale puntare allo sfruttamento ottimale dello spazio esistente sia nei cieli sia negli aerei ci richiede come sottolineato dal relatore misure sotto il profilo personale ed organizzativo
italian la creazione di un unico spazio aereo europeo ci dar per il momento sufficiente respiro per poter configurare partendo dalla situazione attuale misure strutturali per contrastare la crescita sfrenata del trasporto aereo
italian infatti questo che dobbiamo fare se vogliamo trasformare in realt le aspirazioni ad una politica dei trasporti sostenibile
italian non dobbiamo soltanto stimolare ma anche imporre restrizioni ove necessario
italian per il momento per il relatore offre alcuni spunti interessanti
italian non molliamo la presa ma continuiamo a riflettere sul futuro del settore dei trasporti e del trasporto aereo in particolare
italian la relazione atkins concerne uno degli ambiti pi importanti tra le competenze della signora commissario de palacio e del parlamento europeo per i prossimi quattro o cinque anni desidero quindi congratularmi con l onorevole atkins per l approccio adottato nella relazione in questione
italian e ovvio che il problema enorme
italian tenuto conto di tutti i voli i ritardi sono passati dal percento del al percento del ed entro il i voli sono destinati a raddoppiare tutto ci ha come conseguenza perdite di tempo danni economici saturazione e possibili rischi per la sicurezza
italian per quanto riguarda la gestione del traffico aereo il sistema eurcontrol si rivelato inadeguato
italian in tale contesto indispensabile necessario che la vicepresidente signora de palacio proceda con fermezza come ha fatto sinora verso la creazione di un cielo europeo veramente unico
italian abbandonando la loro giustificata preoccupazione per la gestione dello spazio aereo gli stati membri dovrebbero sforzarsi di guardare al futuro superando i propri confini e le necessit congiunturali
italian dobbiamo provvedere immediatamente alla definizione dei numerosi dettagli tecnici come ad esempio i rapporti tra aviazione civile e militare
italian nel frattempo per i viaggiatori devono ottenere un risarcimento per i ritardi delle compagnie aeree ed essere informati dei loro diritti
italian concludo l intervento ribadendo la posizione del parlamento al momento di votare la relazione sulla cig abbiamo stabilito che il piano regolatore del traffico aereo negli stati membri debba passare all unione
italian signor presidente desidero ringraziare l onorevole atkins per la sua relazione e anche per la sua disponibilit a collaborare per la stesura del documento non solo con il mio gruppo ma anche con gli altri
italian non ci sono dubbi i ritardi causati dal controllo del traffico aereo sono un problema come risulta evidente visitando qualsiasi grande aeroporto in questo periodo
italian mi dicono che il ritardo medio si aggira sui minuti
italian per esperienza personale dir soltanto che qualcuno deve nutrire un avversione particolare per l aeroporto di manchester infatti quando devo volare con sabena da bruxelles a manchester il ritardo sempre ben superiore ai minuti
italian posso dire con certezza che per chi deve programmare un viaggio l orario puramente indicativo
italian si tratta quindi di un problema che dobbiamo affrontare
italian la relazione deve prendere in esame tutti le questioni relative al traffico aereo e adottare un duplice approccio come ha proposto la commissione
italian non tutti i ritardi sono per dovuti ai controlli del traffico aereo
italian per le compagnie aeree un ottima scusa scaricare la colpa dei ritardi sul traffico aereo in aeroporto non c mai nessun rappresentante dei controllori del traffico aereo per dire che ci non vero
italian francamente molti ritardi sono provocati dall inefficienza di alcune compagnie aeree
italian i passeggeri non si trovano mi ha sempre stupito il gran numero di passeggeri che manca all appello negli aeroporti
italian che cosa combina questa gente mi chiedo
italian invariabilmente anche loro al pari del traffico aereo provocano ritardi
italian la questione di eurocontrol importante siamo a favore del compromesso raggiunto a questo proposito con il punto
italian concordiamo inoltre sul fatto che i militari debbano cedere parte del loro spazio aereo
italian infine ci sono alcuni emendamenti presentati dal gruppo tdi
italian sono particolarmente interessato all emendamento n
italian posso soltanto presumere che il gruppo tdi debba
italian il presidente interrompe l oratore
italian signor presidente anch io vorrei ringraziare il relatore per l ottimo lavoro
italian l esperienza di luned scorso conferma che si tratta di una relazione estremamente importante
italian molti parlamentari hanno impiegato persino quindici ore per arrivare qui a strasburgo in aereo alcuni voli sono stati cancellati e molti erano in enorme ritardo
italian la situazione davvero insostenibile lo spazio aereo congestionato i voli subiscono continui ritardi e i diritti dei passeggeri sono del tutto inesistenti
italian la relazione propone alcune azioni giuste che vanno attuate senza esitazione
italian non credo comunque che bastino visto che si prevede il raddoppio del traffico aereo nel prossimo decennio
italian alcuni voli brevi devono essere sostituiti dal servizio ferroviario per riservare spazio ai voli su distanze pi lunghe per i quali non ci sono alternative
italian le relazioni volte a migliorare la competitivit del trasporto ferroviario sono importantissime anche da questo punto di vista
italian si deve anche porre in evidenza la tassa sull ambiente prevista dai programmi sul traffico aereo affinche non gravi in maniera irragionevole sui voli a lungo raggio e incoraggi a trasferire i voli brevi su linee ferroviarie
italian signor presidente signora commissario onorevoli colleghi con la globalizzazione abbiamo scoperto che partendo dalla nostra citt gli aerei ci portano in qualsiasi parte del mondo e ci ci piaciuto tanto che non possiamo pi vivere senza volare
italian tuttavia cos come ad un certo momento abbiamo scoperto che le citt erano congestionate a causa delle automobili ora lo spazio aereo che si sta congestionando per via dell eccessivo traffico si accumulano abitualmente ritardi le valigie si smarriscono e abbiamo dovuto sopportare qualsiasi tipo di sciopero bianco e di agitazione sindacale
italian noi consumatori riteniamo che i nostri diritti vadano stabiliti e difesi e che occorra gestire meglio le linee aeree gli aeroporti gli orari dei voli e il controllo della navigazione aerea
italian tuttavia pensiamo che occorra condividere maggiormente la sovranit aerea tra tutti gli europei e che esista una vasta parte dello spazio aereo riservato che non viene sfruttato socialmente come i tempi richiedono
italian per questo motivo oltre a riformare eurocontrol ad aumentare il numero di frequenze radio e ad applicare tecnologie migliori e nuove nella gestione del traffico affinche possano trovare posto pi corridoi aerei e pi aerei negli attuali tempi di normalit necessario che l aviazione commerciale civile possa utilizzare gli spazi riservati soprattutto alle quote o alle altitudini pi elevate che di solito non sono molto usate dai militari
italian i cittadini lo chiedono e credo che sia possibile trovare una soluzione accettabile per tutti condividendo lo sottolineo ancora una volta la sovranit e lo spazio riservato utilizzato per l aviazione militare
italian signor presidente signora commissario onorevoli colleghi al pari del relatore e degli oratori precedenti penso anch io che urga adottare misure adeguate per affrontare e risolvere una volta per tutte il problema dei crescenti ritardi nel traffico aereo europeo
italian la discussione in sede di commissione ed anche oggi qui in assemblea plenaria insiste sui modi i mezzi e i metodi migliori per cambiare la gestione del traffico aereo
italian l onorevole atkins di cui apprezzo la competenza specifica e la maggioranza della commissione per la politica regionale i trasporti e il turismo ritengono che tale obiettivo possa essere raggiunto soprattutto attraverso misure di liberalizzazione
italian e fuor di dubbio che la liberalizzazione porta ad un aumento del numero dei prestatori di servizi essa per non in grado di risolvere determinati problemi anzi ne crea di nuovi
italian primo finche gli stati membri continueranno a porre i loro legittimi interessi nazionali al di sopra di quelli paneuropei per quanto concerne il coordinamento e l utilizzo dello spazio aereo europeo non si avr alcun cambiamento sostanziale
italian secondo tale situazione anche una causa della scarsa efficienza di eurocontrol
italian non importa che si giunga o meno ad una separazione tra organi competenti per la regolamentazione e quelli competenti per il controllo non importa che si liberalizzi oppure si privatizzi finche non ci sar la volont politica di accettare il fatto che la questione dello spazio aereo europeo va affrontata in un contesto paneuropeo non ci sar nulla da fare e non ci potranno essere d aiuto neppure altre dieci relazioni
italian terzo va privilegiato lo sfruttamento civile dello spazio aereo
italian in un europa unita e pacificata non c pi alcun motivo valido per continuare a riservare al settore militare gran parte dello spazio aereo
italian quarto non credete che facendo della liberalizzazione un feticcio la possibilit che le offerte di servizi per le rotte meno lucrative si riducano al minimo e che non si possa sviluppare una concorrenza leale se non si stabiliscono standard sociali e di sicurezza vincolanti e unitari
italian quinto non c alcun bisogno che la commissione eserciti la sua influenza sui governi nazionali in caso di conflitti di lavoro come si chiede al punto della relazione c bisogno invece di un dialogo sociale ben funzionante tra tutte le parti interessate al traffico aereo
italian signor presidente la relazione dell onorevole atkins espone alcuni problemi sollevati dall evoluzione del sistema aereo in europa
italian la questione della sicurezza innanzitutto
italian le controversie del lavoro che a volte creano scompiglio nel traffico prendono in ostaggio senza preavviso migliaia di utenti
italian i ritardi sempre pi numerosi ed intollerabili non sono soltanto imputabil come gi segnalat alla congestione degli spazi aerei ma anche alla pretesa delle compagnie per esigenze di redditivit di far effettuare ai propri aerei rotazioni con tempi eccessivamente brevi irragionevoli e in definitiva impraticabili
italian la relazione non accenna tuttavia ad una questione essenziale quella dei diritti del traffico attualmente molto difficile per una compagnia europea che copre ad esempio la tratta parig
italian housto san francisco imbarcare passeggeri in california perche dal punto di vista giuridico ci considerato cabotaggio mentre una compagnia aerea americana con un volo new yor
italian madri
italian parigi pu imbarcare passeggeri in spagna e farli sbarcare in europa e nel negoziato internazionale dei diritti del traffico che tale concetto di spazio aereo europeo
italian il presidente toglie la parola all oratore
italian signor presidente si pu osservare che il trasporto aereo diventato progressivamente accessibile ad un maggior numero di cittadini europei
italian tale democratizzazione certo bene accetta ma solleva importanti questioni per il futuro crescita del traffico intasamento degli aeroporti congestione dello spazio aereo e mancanza di rispetto dell ambiente segnatamente in termini di inquinamento acustico
italian la volont di creare un traffico aereo ottimale in europa animata da buoni sentimenti ma perche la commissione dovrebbe rimettere in discussione le politiche aeree degli stati membri ed i loro accordi bilaterali mediante uno spazio aereo unico
italian sottoscrivo da un lato l obiettivo di razionalizzazione dei movimenti di aerei e dall altro l obiettivo di ricerca di una migliore fluidit del traffico nel pieno rispetto della tutela dei consumatori e della sicurezza degli utenti
italian mi piacerebbe credere alla signora commissario de palacio quando assicura che cito nei lavori della commissione non si accenna affatto a mettere in concorrenza i servizi del controllo aereo ne a privatizzarli
italian le agitazioni del personale interessato sarebbero quindi prive di fondamento
italian la commissione chiede l avvento di un autorit preposta alla gestione del traffico aereo che sia un autorit regolamentatrice forte
italian
italian sono contrario a tale proposta mi oppongo ad una completa revisione di eurocontrol cos come ad una nuova struttura normativ l attuale funzionamento organizza con efficacia a conti fatti in particolare in materia di sicurezza un traffico equilibrato rispettando i sistemi nazionali a cui ciascuno stato deve poter avere diritto nonche al fatto che la commissione rappresenti gli stati membri presso gli altri stati annullando di fatto qualsiasi potere decisionale politico in materia di trasporto aereo
italian signor presidente signora vicepresidente della commissione tanto la comunicazione della commissione quanto l eccellente documento del relatore sono in linea con lo scorso consiglio europeo di lisbona durante il quale stata chiesta alla commissione una serie di proposte concrete nel minor tempo possibile
italian ora spetta al consiglio prendere le decisioni politiche necessarie e urgenti che consentano d integrare il mercato unico dell aviazione con un sistema unico di controllo del traffico aereo
italian attualmente la crescita della domanda si colloca tra il e il percento annuo ed probabile che si mantenga sullo stesso livello nei prossimi anni il che rende ancora pi arduo il lavoro di uno dei sistemi europei di gestione del traffico aereo che hanno dimostrato di non essere in grado di far fronte a tale sviluppo e ai quali dovuto oltre il percento dei ritardi anche se vi sono altre cause come le limitazioni degli aeroporti nonche una programmazione dei voli che non tiene conto dei limiti delle infrastrutture
italian ulteriori cause della scarsa efficacia del sistema attuale sono la diversit dell organizzazione del sistema civile rispetto a quello militare nonche i diversi standard relativi alle infrastrutture tecniche di terra
italian lo spazio aereo dev essere accessibile alle stesse condizioni all aviazione generale commerciale e militare il che non significa che non si attribuisca priorit o addirittura esclusivit di accesso ai militari nell eventualit di una crisi
italian il semplice fatto che si possa verificare una crisi non giustifica che alcuni stati membri mantengano le norme che vigevano durante la guerra fredda
italian e necessario che i controllori civili e militari presso le torri di controllo lavorino in stretta collaborazione
italian e chiara la necessit di arrivare ad una cooperazione pi efficace tra i diversi usi dello spazio e a mio avviso tale cooperazione o impostazione comune dovr essere ricercata a livello europeo
italian mi congratulo con il relatore e con la vicepresidente della commissione per i punti in comune individuati in un settore cos importante e delicato per la vita quotidiana dei cittadini
italian la relazione dell onorevole atkins un documento dettagliato ed equilibrato che riflette esattamente l attuale posizione del parlamento
italian signora vicepresidente sappia che siamo al corrente degli sforzi da lei compiuti e che avr il nostro sostegno lungo la linea da lei intrapresa
italian signor presidente nutro grosse riserve in merito alla relazione atkins in quanto dietro alle migliori intenzioni del mondo essa cela interessi commerciali
italian in realt le compagnie aeree auspicano la liberalizzazione totale del controllo aereo non tanto per motivi di sicurezza di interoperabilit o di riduzione dei ritardi quanto per poter accedere ad un mercato dei servizi di controllo che consentirebbe alle pi potenti di pagarsi bande orarie care ma protette e di lasciare alle altre e all aviazione privata il peso dei ritardi
italian una tale liberalizzazione sotto forma di cielo unico comporterebbe un cielo a pi velocit
italian non mi spiego diversamente la caccia alle streghe che emerge dalla relazione nei confronti dei servizi di controllo civile
italian sappiamo tutti che il grosso dei ritardi dipende dalle servit militari dato che soltanto il percento di ess che va peraltro indubbiamente contrastat riconducibile al controllo aereo
italian si tratta di un problema politico che dipende innanzitutto dalle politiche
italian e risaputo che il notevole aumento del traffico aereo la principale causa tendenziale di congestione e di saturazione dello spazio aereo cos come si sa che occorrerebbe ridurre il numero di piste e piattaforme per avere una qualche possibilit di ottenere una pausa una semplice interruzione nella saturazione
italian nel mio paese le compagnie aeree hanno deciso di predisporre alcune navette che inviano tutte le mattine dalle alle da ciascuna citt di provincia francese una dozzina di aeromobili di piccole dimensioni sulla sola piattaforma parigina
italian e forse colpa del controllo aereo se esso nega loro l autorizzazione ad atterrare tutte insieme a parigi
italian ecco le principali cause dei ritardi aerei
italian si deve instaurare il cielo unico tramite la riforma di eurocontrol e tramite servizi di controllo armonizzati su scala europea
italian tuttavia mi risulta difficile immaginare che dei servizi di sicurezza collettivi possano essere guidati dal solo profitto sotto il controllo di azionisti e che il cielo unico europeo possa trasformarsi domani in un cielo disuguale tra compagnie aeree
italian signora commissario spero che la commissione nel predisporre la futura direttiva sul cielo unico sappia affrontare tale questione con maggiore imparzialit globalit e serenit
italian signor presidente mi faccio portavoce della protesta dei controllori aerei contro il progetto della commissione europea che con il riuscito slogan di cielo unico europeo aprir la strada alla privatizzazione del controllo aereo
italian la relazione atkins si presta alle interferenze da parte di gruppi privati che ambiscono a metter mano sul controllo aereo che con la crescita del traffico diventer assai redditizio
italian la relazione parla di ritardi sempre pi frequenti
italian tuttavia in che modo il fatto di sottoporre il controllo aereo alle esigenze del profitto privato potrebbe porre fine ai ritardi
italian e proprio la corsa al profitto delle compagnie aeree che le porta ad effettuare scelte che provocano tali ritardi
italian e nell interesse degli utenti e della loro sicurezza cos come nell interesse dei lavoratori del settore che il controllo aereo rimanga un servizio pubblico con la vocazione esclusiva di assicurare il buon svolgimento del traffico aereo
italian la concorrenza la ricerca del profitto in un settore cos delicato quale il controllo aereo condurranno inevitabilmente alla catastrofe
italian se necessario metter fine ai particolarismi nazionali in materia di gestione del traffico aereo e se legittimo unificare lo spazio aereo europeo lo si deve fare ricusando qualsiasi idea di privatizzazione di concorrenza e di ricerca di redditivit pertanto voteremo contro tale relazione
italian signor presidente mi congratulo con il collega atkins del partito conservatore britannico per l eccellente relazione sul cielo unico europeo
italian essa prova al di l di ogni dubbio che la principale ambizione dell unione europea quella di formare una nazione unica con un unica bandiera nazionale un unico inno nazionale uno spazio giuridico unico confini nazionali unici ben presto i cittadini d europa potranno respirare l aria unica europea
italian tuttavia dopo il fallimento della politica della terra unica europea nota come pac e quello della politica del mare unico europeo nota come pcp possiamo aspettarci un fallimento analogo per la politica del cielo unico anzi visto il gran numero di scioperi dei controllori del traffico aereo penso che possiamo attenderci lo sciopero unico europeo
italian sir robert devo farle le mie congratulazioni lei ha segnato un punto a favore del movimento degli euroscettici nel regno unito
italian signor presidente non c dubbio che necessario affrontare con urgenza il problema dei ritardi nel traffico aereo tuttavia non bisogna dimenticare che il percento dei ritardi atm registrati fra gennaio e giugno dipeso soprattutto da temporanee riduzioni di capacit causate non da ultimo dalla crisi del kosovo
italian il problema reale quello dei settori che si estendono a cavallo tra le zone a nord e a sud svizzera francia italia spagna parti della germania nonche lo spazio aereo di alta quota fissato a maastricht che costituiscono la causa del percento dei ritardi atm e di strozzature
italian in passato anche la grecia rientrava in questo problema
italian tuttavia gli ottimi risultati raggiunti da questo paese dimostrano che quando un governo nazionale agisce con decisione e autentico spirito di cooperazione i miglioramenti sono senz altro possibili
italian troppo spesso eurocontrol viene usato come capro espiatorio ed accusato di essere la causa dell attuale situazione ma la vera responsabilit ricade sull inerzia dei governi nazionali nelle zone che ho appena menzionato
italian e evidente che il consiglio trasporti deve agire immediatamente affinche le decisioni inerenti il controllo del traffico aereo siano applicate dagli stati membri in tutta europa
italian non dimentichiamo che eurocontrol l unica istituzione paneuropea nel campo della gestione del traffico aereo quindi necessario sostenerla
italian infine i governi nazionali devono affrontare con urgenza una delle questioni sollevate in questa sede la grave carenza di personale persone circa tra i controllori del traffico aereo in tutta europa
italian la soluzione di questo problema basterebbe da sola a migliorare notevolmente il controllo del traffico
italian inoltre sia gli aeroporti che le compagnie aeree devono esaminare attentamente le proprie procedure di lavoro poiche troppo spesso anch essi sono responsabili di numerosi ritardi
italian signor presidente mi permetta di iniziare ringraziando il relatore atkins per avere agito con determinazione la commissione per avere inserito questo tema fra le sue priorit e il commissario competente signora de palacio per avere avuto il coraggio di passare dalle parole ai fatti
italian ci ha fatto s che in breve tempo la questione di un controllo comune del traffico aereo si sia pi che mai avvicinata ad una soluzione
italian certo molto ancora resta da fare
italian non da ultimo occorre convincere una serie di stati membri recalcitranti ma proprio per questo cos importante che il parlamento europeo dia oggi alla commissione il suo pieno appoggio per il prosieguo dei lavori
italian ci troviamo proprio nel bel mezzo dell ennesima estate all insegna del caos negli aeroporti
italian l evoluzione in corso condurr al raddoppio del traffico aereo a partire dal
italian ci richiede che vengano prese le decisioni politiche del caso altrimenti rischieremo che in futuro il congestionamento dello spazio aereo non si limiti a causare ritardi di quindici trenta o sessanta minuti cosa che al limite potremmo anche accettare ci sar il rischio di non poter pi garantire la sicurezza questo del tutto inammissibile
italian e in questa prospettiva che occorre valutare la relazione atkins e l operato della commissione
italian l unione europea ha dedicato parecchio tempo ed energia all abolizione dei confini e alla creazione del mercato interno
italian chiunque viaggi a diecimila metri di quot e noi lo facciamo spesso e volentier si rende tuttavia conto che l vi sono frontiere ovunque
italian la relazione contiene un calendario molto stretto
italian e un ambizione che io condivido
italian provvediamo insieme affinche l estate del sia l ultima all insegna del caos nei cieli d europa
italian con l ausilio della relazione atkins la commissione pu effettivamente ottenere questo risultato
italian signor presidente signora vicepresidente della commissione onorevoli colleghi non esiste alcuna relazione che sia di maggiore attualit di quella ora in discussione
italian appena in tempo prima della pausa estiva quando tutti vanno in vacanza e sempre pi persone viaggiano anche in aereo il parlamento si occupa oggi della questione del traffico aereo
italian un tema non piacevole come sappiamo bene noi e come sanno bene anche tutti gli utenti del trasporto aereo spesso costretti a subire ritardi di ore e ore che toccano noi tutti
italian fa parte ormai della quotidianit degli aeroporti l immagine di passeggeri annoiati nervosi se non addirittura aggressivi che riempiono le sale d aspetto
italian noi deputati subiamo questo fenomeno forse pi ancora degli altri ma lo subiscono pure ampi strati della popolazione che utilizzano l aereo per le vacanze
italian vorrei citare un altro aspetto
italian il problema dei ritardi nei collegamenti aerei ha conseguenze negative non soltanto per i passeggeri che usano l aereo per viaggi di lavoro e vengono cos a trovarsi in gravi difficolt personali perche non possono rispettare impegni ed appuntamenti il ritardo di un volo comporta anche oneri aggiuntivi sotto forma di spese per il carburante nonche un maggiore inquinamento ambientale
italian mi fa pertanto piacere che la commissione abbia presentato una relazione su questa tematica cos importante e che sia stato coinvolto anche il gruppo ad alto livello che si occupa dei problemi e della creazione di uno spazio aereo europeo
italian mi auguro che in autunno potremo disporre puntualmente dei risultati definitivi delle ricerche condotte per passare poi dalle parole ai fatti d intesa con la commissione
italian l aspetto della sicurezza di tutti i passeggeri ma soprattutto di chi utilizza l aereo frequentemente al primissimo posto
italian gli standard di sicurezza non devono in nessun modo essere messi in pericolo
italian a tale scopo gli spazi di volo devono essere controllati e tutelati al meglio
italian eurocontrol deve soddisfare i requisiti di sicurezza ma noi dobbiamo creare le necessarie condizioni quadro
italian es signor presidente in primo luogo desidero congratularmi con l onorevole atkins per l impegno e il lavoro serio e rigoroso svolto in questi mesi e che come ha detto molto bene il relatore della commissione per l industria onorevole zimeray ha richiamato l attenzione sulla situazione di frammentazione dello spazio aereo per quanto riguarda sia le frontiere amministrative esistenti sia le frammentazioni tecnologiche dovute ai diversi sistemi applicati nei vari paesi
italian detto questo onorevoli deputati occorre prendere spunto da quanto sottolineato dalla relazione l incremento del traffico aereo e l aumento dei ritardi non c nessuno pi adatto degli onorevoli parlamentari per testimoniare questa situazione
italian bisogna dire chiaramente che non tutti i ritardi sono dovuti alla gestione del traffico aereo quasi la met dovuta alle compagnie aeree agli aeroporti e a volte alle condizioni meteorologiche
italian tuttavia vero che vi un percento o forse poco pi di ritardi che attribuibile a problemi di gestione del traffico aereo
italian vorrei sottolineare inoltre che ci non significa che i colpevoli siano i controllori di volo
italian non un problema attinente ad alcune persone che svolgono un lavoro di grande tensione estremamente difficile e complesso e che fanno quanto possibile per garantire il massimo livello di sicurezza che il problema principale il massimo livello di sicurezza
italian a volte i controllori devono svolgere il proprio lavoro con un sovraccarico di voli con scarsit di personale il che li obbliga a lavorare pi ore del dovuto nonche con metodi tecnologie sussidi tecnologici non sufficientemente sviluppati
italian desidero chiarire che non un problema che concerne le persone cio i controllori i qual insist svolgono un lavoro magnifico
italian devo dire loro che impressionante vederli all opera perche essi hanno la responsabilit della vita di tutti i passeggeri che in quel momento si trovano a bordo dell aereo
italian a mio giudizi come sottolinea l iniziativa cielo unico il sistema di gestione che non funziona che ci pone dinanzi ad una situazione frammentata contraddistinta da barriere e frontiere amministrativ in un unione che stata in grado di mettere in comune tante cose nonche dalle divisioni artificiali tra cielo ad uso militare e cielo ad uso civile che sussistono in molti paesi quando ormai da tempo abbiamo superato la guerra fredda e che oltre tutto non corrispondono alle necessit reali di difesa
italian infatti onorevoli deputati la maggior parte dei voli di difesa ha luogo alle quote basse dello spazio aereo e non a quelle alte
italian inoltre queste zone dello spazio aereo vengono utilizzate solo poche ore al giorno non tutti i giorni e molte di esse solo poche volte all anno
italian onorevoli deputati si tratta quindi di mettere in comune la zona superiore dello spazio aereo di gestirla in comun come suggerito poco fa da un oratore dimenticandoci delle frontiere in quella zona superiore dello spazio aereo smettendo di parlare di spazio aereo britannico spagnolo francese o svedese e parlando semplicemente di spazio aereo europeo in questa zona alta e lasciando la gestione nazionale al di sotto dei piedi o dei piedi questa zona andr specificata per quanto in questo caso sorga un altro tipo di problemi e l uso militare risulti pi chiaro
italian ad ogni modo necessario impostare in maniera flessibile l uso civile e militare dello spazio aereo migliorare l efficacia della gestione e fornire ai controllori aerei che ora a volte lavorano in situazioni francamente complesse un ambiente pi facile che consenta loro di svolgere meglio il proprio lavoro
italian onorevoli deputati si parlato di tempi
italian in linea di massima il gruppo ad alto livello a cui trasmetter le conclusioni del parlamento durante la prossima riunione del luglio concluder i lavori entro il mese di ottobre
italian pertanto le proposte concrete che potranno avere origine in seguito saranno presentate nei mesi successivi e speriamo che per il prossimo consiglio europeo di primavera sotto la presidenza svedese le proposte concrete siano gi state avviate
italian la tabella di marcia questa
italian l iniziativa cielo unico non vuol dire affatto sopprimere eurocontrol
italian al contrario eurocontrol assolutamente indispensabile un elemento essenziale che va rafforzato integrato dato che nell unione europea possibile andare oltre l ambito di eurocontrol
italian su questa base onorevoli deputati necessario parlare di un ente regolatore europeo comune e forte e occorre abbandonare la polemica secondo me artificiale tra privatizzazione o non privatizzazione perche non vi dubbio che essa non troverebbe mai posto nella comunicazione o nelle proposte della commissione
italian non addentriamoci in questo tipo di questioni
italian non questo l obiettivo dell iniziativa
italian lo potr fare un paese nell ambito delle sue competenze ma certamente al margine dell iniziativa cielo unico
italian al contrario questa iniziativa consentir di garantire un ente regolatore europeo pubblico forte
italian l iniziativa consiste in questo ossia nel superare le frammentazioni e nell introdurre maggiore flessibilit
italian onorevoli deputati ringrazio tutti per il lavoro svolto in particolare il relatore l onorevole atkins e mi auguro che tra tutti riusciremo a migliorare la gestione del traffico aereo in uno degli aspetti non l unico che riguarda i ritardi
italian stiamo lavorando anche per risolvere il problema degli slot e altri problemi ma dobbiamo affrontare una cosa per volta e al momento opportuno
italian la ringrazio signora commissario
italian la discussione chiusa
italian la votazione si svolger oggi alle
italian sicurezza e salute delle lavoratrici gestanti
italian l ordine del giorno reca la discussione sulla relazione a presentata dalla onorevole dami o a nome della commissione per l occupazione e gli affari sociali sulla relazione della commissione sulla trasposizione della direttiva cee del consiglio del ottobre concernente l attuazione di misure volte a promuovere il miglioramento della sicurezza e della salute sul lavoro delle lavoratrici gestanti puerpere o in periodo di allattamento
italian signor presidente ritengo che lo strumento legislativo che oggi esaminiamo nella relazione valutativa inviataci dalla commissione abbia concluso il suo percorso per quanto concerne i diritti contrattuali e i sistemi di previdenza sociale
italian questo strumento che ha apportato vantaggi a migliaia di lavoratrici in numerosi paesi dell unione ormai superato
italian e superato perche sta per concludersi la revisione della convenzione dell oil che risale al e ci si attende che la maggior parte dei paesi del mondo migliori sostanzialmente la tutela della maternit
italian chiaramente si sperav e si sper che l unione continui a essere in questo campo come in altri socialmente pi progredita
italian di conseguenza non tutto superato perche in materia di organizzazione del lavoro la direttiva ha avuto una trasposizione insufficiente e la sua applicazione stata ancor pi inadeguata
italian nella maggior parte dei paesi non vengono rispettate le tre fasi dell organizzazione del posto di lavoro ossia cambiamento del posto di lavoro nei posti giudicati pericolosi cambiamento di lavoratrice e solo dopo rilascio di un congedo di malattia che riduce gli introiti della lavoratrice nonche le sue aspettative di carriera
italian a titolo esemplificativo dir che in alcuni paesi non si rispetta nemmeno il periodo minimo di recupero postnatale che secondo gli specialisti di giorni per un parto normale in un posto di lavoro normale
italian vi sono pertanto paesi che in qualche modo non rispettano queste regole con il pretesto di offrire alle donne un alternativa
italian riteniamo che debba essere garantita alle donne l alternativa di avere un buon congedo di maternit ripartito con il padre ma il congedo relativo al rischio per la sua salute dev essere valutato e garantito
italian d altro canto la valutazione dei rischi in questa direttiva non collegata con le altre segnatamente la direttiva quadro sulla valutazione dei rischi e sull informazione ai lavoratori
italian oltre a non essere collegata fa ricadere sull occupazione femminile un anatema ingiusto ossia che i costi dei rischi per la maternit si applicano esclusivamente alle donne in et fertile
italian questi costi sono sottovalutati e non devono gravare sul datore di lavoro o costituire un obbligo del datore non appena il medico della lavoratrice lo informa dello stato di quest ultima
italian in primo luogo perche tardi i rischi derivanti dalle radiazioni dagli ambienti chimici e da una postura scorretta sono gi stati corsi e possono avere conseguenze nefaste sulla salute della donna e del feto proprio nelle prime settimane
italian in secondo luogo perche non tutelano la capacit riproduttiva di uomini e donne e l infertilit ha attualmente una dimensione considerevole nell unione infatti oltre l percento delle coppie europee ha questo problema che deriva dallo stile di vita causato dall organizzazione economica che abbiamo e anche dal fatto che non si prendono le dovute cautele contro questi pericoli per fare un esempio posso citare le temperature estreme che provocano l infertilit femminile e maschile
italian sarebbe opportuno che l unione elaborasse e applicasse delle leggi in questo senso oggi che nelle condizioni di poterlo fare per quanto riguarda i congedi siamo a conoscenza dei costi molto pi elevati nel caso di assunzione di una donna
italian sappiamo anche che gli specialisti raccomandano cinque mesi come minimo perche il bambino appena nato si senta in una casa protetta dal mondo esterno e soprattutto cresca in un ambiente psico affettivo favorevole che gli dia l equilibrio necessario per svilupparsi con questa sicurezza perche ha bisogno dei genitori
italian e per questo che il congedo dev essere esteso a entrambi i progenitori in una condivisione sana
italian consentitemi di aggiungere che la direttiva deve prendere in considerazione anche l economia sommersa e i contratti di lavoro atipici
italian infine spero che la commissione ci dir che cosa intende fare a questo riguardo dato che oggi dispone di una base giuridica ampi gli articoli e che permette di affrontare altri aspetti a cui si fa riferimento nella relazione
italian signor presidente onorevoli colleghi la onorevole dami o ha preparato un eccellente relazione nella quale ha ben recepito il parere da me formulato a nome della commissione per i diritti della donna e le pari opportunit
italian il miglioramento della sicurezza e della tutela della salute sul posto di lavoro di lavoratrici gestanti puerpere e in periodo di allattamento di particolare rilevanza per tutti sia per la donna sia per il nascituro
italian si tratta di un tema che coinvolge l intera societ e che va affrontato con la massima cura
italian la relazione della commissione sulla direttiva del si occupa soltanto dell applicazione concreta della direttiva e non tiene conto delle condizioni del posto di lavoro che si sono in parte modificate ne del mutato ruolo della donna nella societ
italian e cambiato inoltre il numero delle madri sole e infine non va dimenticato che per le donne l obiettivo dell indipendenza economica diventa sempre pi importante
italian la commissione deve presentare una proposta di modifica della direttiva che tenga conto di tutti questi cambiamenti e lo deve fare quanto prima possibile entro l anno in corso
italian occorre adeguare e migliorare le disposizioni legislative sotto molti aspetti in particolare introducendo misure preventive a tutela della salute sul posto di lavoro tanto per la madre quanto per il nascituro
italian bisogna eliminare i fattori di rischio
italian mansioni nocive alla salute devono essere vietate senza eccezione alcuna
italian occorre regolamentare gli orari di allattamento e dev essere possibile allattare sul posto di lavoro
italian il congedo post parto dovrebbe avere una durata minima di otto settimane
italian inoltre vanno definite chiaramente due questioni il sostegno finanziario da concedere sia durante il congedo di gravidanza sia dopo il parto e il reinserimento nel posto di lavoro
italian tutte queste disposizioni di cui si avverte la necessit non devono tuttavia comportare discriminazioni a carico delle donne ne indebolire la loro posizione sul mercato del lavoro
italian signor presidente onorevoli colleghi la direttiva cee del consiglio del ottobre della cui attuazione stiamo discutendo una delle direttive pi importanti nel settore della tutela tecnica e sanitaria dei lavoratori
italian ricordo benissimo la fase preparatoria della direttiva come pure i problemi affrontati all epoca
italian va valutato positivamente il fatto che in quella occasione nonostante i contrasti sulla base giuridica fu riconosciuta l importanza della direttiva per le lavoratrici del mercato unico e si comp il primo passo verso la fissazione di standard minimi di tutela delle lavoratrici gestanti e delle giovani madri
italian nella relazione della commissione oggi in esame si evidenziano una volta di pi le carenze di attuazione della direttiva ci deve indurci ad aumentare il nostro impegno volto a realizzare una tutela non solo giuridica ma anche effettiva delle donne che si trovano in una fase particolare della loro vita
italian per una societ infatti molto triste dover constatare che si deve riservare ancora tanta attenzione a questa tematica
italian appoggio quindi la richiesta di sottoporre quanto prima la direttiva ad una revisione credo per che non riusciremo a farlo entro la fine del
italian gli emendamenti presentati contengono richieste singole che devono trovare spazio in una proposta di modifica della direttiva il gruppo ppe de appoggia alcuni di questi emendamenti mi riferisco innanzitutto alla richiesta di introdurre un severo divieto di licenziamento durante il congedo di gravidanza e maternit nonche la garanzia che alla conclusione del periodo di congedo le lavoratrici siano reintegrate nel vecchio posto di lavoro o siano assegnate ad uno equiparabile
italian le violazioni contro tali divieti devono essere sanzionate in maniera efficace in caso contrario le donne che vogliono o devono conciliare la professione con la maternit subirebbero una penalizzazione o un ingiustificata discriminazione nella loro vita professionale e privata
italian in tale ottica un efficace tutela delle lavoratrici gestanti e delle giovani madri rappresenta uno dei pi importanti contributi ad un attiva politica a favore della famiglia
italian in considerazione dell ampliamento ad est e della tutela esistente in quei paesi rilevo che non ammissibile che il mercato unico abbia conseguenze negative per la tutela delle gestanti e delle giovani madri
italian signor presidente signora commissario innanzitutto un ringraziamento alla relatrice per il lavoro approfondito serio e senza reticenze fatto con questa relazione
italian parliamo di un tema molto sensibile che ha strette relazioni con problemi che periodicamente vengono evocati l invecchiamento della popolazione l andamento demografico il basso tasso di natalit il diritto alla salute il diritto al lavoro il diritto alla maternit il valore sociale della maternit che non pu restare solo un problema individuale della donna ma deve trovare tutela e sostegno nella societ
italian la direttiva del di cui valutiamo oggi l applicazione negli stati membri ha proprio l obiettivo di stabilire misure minime per promuovere il miglioramento della sicurezza e della salute sul lavoro delle lavoratrici gestanti e puerpere in periodo di allattamento
italian la relazione di valutazione della commissione dimostra che la direttiva si dimostrata utile ha portato alcuni vantaggi in taluni stati membri su alcuni aspetti del problema quali congedi per motivi di salute e sicurezza eccetera a parte per queste considerazioni di carattere generale noi condividiamo il giudizio critico della relatrice sulla relazione della commissione
italian e una relazione presentata in ritardo rispetto ai tempi stabiliti e che si sofferma quasi esclusivamente sugli aspetti del recepimento a livello giuridico e tecnico
italian mancano infatti statistiche e dati concreti sugli aspetti vitali della direttiva come la verifica della valutazione dei rischi nei luoghi di lavoro per le lavoratrici gestanti la frequenza degli incidenti e delle malattie professionali non ci sono informazioni soddisfacenti sul coordinamento dell adeguamento regolamentare delle ispezioni specialistiche delle sanzioni applicate delle ricerche scientifiche mirate a riconoscere prevenire eliminare risarcire i rischi professionali
italian e mancat ci sembr un serio controllo da parte della commissione mancato un coordinamento fra la direzione salute e sicurezza e quella delle pari opportunit ed venuta alla luce l ambiguit che da questo punto di vista la direttiva stessa presenta
italian il ritardo di un rapporto di valutazion ricordo che proprio per i bassi standard minimi previsti si ottenne il consenso dell italia solo in cambio dell impegno di una rapida verific avrebbe dovuto portare ad una proposta da parte della commissione di una revisione della direttiva particolarmente su alcuni aspetti che vengono richiamati dalla relatrice la durata del congedo di maternit il prolungamento del congedo di maternit in situazioni di rischio una definizione pi precisa del concetto di indennit adeguata il divieto di licenziamento durante la gravidanza e il congedo di maternit con sanzioni efficaci il divieto di qualsiasi discriminazione per quanto attiene ai percorsi professionali e al miglioramento delle condizioni di lavoro la messa in atto di tutte le misure necessarie atte a tutelare la salute e la sicurezza della donna e del feto senza pregiudizio per il diritto al lavoro e al percorso professionale favorire l allattamento al seno attraverso misure diversificate
italian pur tenendo conto di tutte le compatibilit necessarie ci che dovrebbe ispirare la commissione e gli stati membri nella revisione della direttiva il principio di non discriminazione e il riconoscimento della maternit e della paternit quali diritti fondamentali essenziali all equilibrio della societ
italian signor presidente importante che alle donne durante la gravidanza e il parto siano assicurate serenit e sicurezza affinche la madre e il bambino inizino la nuova vita con il piede giusto ed importante che la gravidanza e la maternit non riducano le possibilit delle donne sul mercato del lavoro
italian abbiamo una direttiva del che stabilisce i diritti minimi in materia di congedi di maternit e il diritto ad un indennit per le donne mentre sono lontane dal mercato del lavoro per maternit
italian la commissione ha esaminato la trasposizione della direttiva negli stati membri e nella relazione la onorevole dami o segnala a ragione che il documento della commissione offre solo un sommario tecnico e fattuale del recepimento della direttiva e non valuta se la direttiva nella pratica assicuri alle gestanti o alle puerpere condizioni migliori
italian per questo la relatrice ritiene che il documento della commissione non rappresenti una base sufficiente su cui effettuare una revisione della direttiva
italian sono d accordo con la relatrice
italian per questo non sono favorevole a sollecitare una revisione della direttiva adesso
italian non credo che dovremmo chiedere una proposta di una nuova direttiva che contenga il diritto al prolungamento del congedo di maternit e l estensione del congedo obbligatorio e che stabilisca requisiti pi precisi in merito all indennit non tenendo conto in misura sufficiente delle differenze tra i sistemi sociali degli stati membri
italian le norme attuali prevedono una grande flessibilit e la maggior parte dei paesi garantisce alle donne condizioni migliori di quelle previste dalla normativa comunitaria
italian ci si pu chiedere se nuove norme possano avere un grande impatto a livello pratico
italian in ogni caso il congedo di maternit e l aiuto economico fanno parte di priorit che devono essere definite nei singoli paesi
italian ritengo invece che sarebbe positivo avere un immagine pi chiara delle condizioni esistenti nei vari paesi affinche i governi possano imparare dalle esperienze positive e negative degli altri ed ispirarsi a vicenda
italian signor presidente onorevoli colleghi alla fine del la commissione europea deve presentare una proposta di direttiva sulle misure relative alle lavoratrici gestanti puerpere o in periodo di allattamento
italian la valutazione delle misure esistenti giunge con quattro anni di ritardo e non soddisfa ai requisiti posti all epoca dal parlamento europeo inoltre non va dimenticato che tale valutazione era mirata a portare ad una modifica
italian il gruppo verts ale vuole che la tutela venga ampliata
italian nella relazione vengono citati soprattutto aspetti istituzionali
italian riteniamo che debba essere aggiunto il diritto a rientrare dopo il congedo di maternit nella stessa funzione o in una funzione equivalente presso il medesimo datore di lavoro
italian si chiede un ampliamento dei diritti delle lavoratrici gestanti o in periodo di allattamento
italian nella realt pratica infatti spesso le donne vengono discriminate durante quel periodo malgrado i diritti teorici di cui godono
italian pertanto chiediamo l inversione dell onere della prova
italian sar il datore di lavoro a dover dimostrare che un licenziamento o un trasferimento non sono conseguenti alla gravidanza
italian infine esortiamo la commissione a spiegare perche in occasione dell ultima riunione dell ilo gli stati membri non abbiano adottato i pareri comuni
italian com possibile che il regno unito si sia astenuto durante la votazione finale il che vista la procedura equivale ad un voto contrario
italian infine ringrazio la onorevole dami o per il lavoro svolto
italian signor presidente in un momento in cui l europa sottolinea nella riunione di pechino a new york il proprio ruolo di pioniere nell attuazione del principio di eguaglianza tra uomini e donne pare altrettanto importante garantire la loro libert
italian tale libert passa attraverso un diritto di tutela specifico delle donne diritto sempre legato al loro corpo in particolar modo alla maternit pi precisamente alla gravidanza
italian ci congratuliamo con la onorevole dami o per l ottima relazione che evidenzia l urgenza di rivedere la direttiva del
italian la sua richiesta di formale divieto di licenziamento durante la gravidanza fondamentale e mi soffermerei unicamente su tale punto
italian mi pare pericoloso lasciare al datore di lavoro un margine di manovra che egli sapr sempre utilizzare a proprio vantaggio
italian oggi con la revisione della convenzione l oil livella al basso la tutela delle lavoratrici gestanti accettando alcuni licenziamenti detti senza nesso con la gravidanza
italian l europa con la relazione della onorevole dami o e la revisione della direttiva ha il dovere di porsi come riferimento politico per i diritti delle donne del mondo intero
italian signor presidente onorevoli colleghi desidero innanzitutto rallegrarmi con la nostra collega la onorevole elisa dami o per lo straodinario lavoro da lei eseguito con questa relazione alla quale abbiamo dato il nostro contributo in commissione non soltanto appoggiandola totalmente ma anche introducendo alcune rettifiche che sono state in seguito accolte nella versione finale
italian consideriamo l approvazione di questa relazione un momento importante nell ambito di questa sessione legislativa per quattro ragioni fondamentali
italian in primo luogo perche riteniamo inaccettabile che la donna sia socialmente danneggiata o discriminata a causa della gravidanza e della maternit
italian in secondo luogo perche necessario che ci dedichiamo con vigore ai problemi dei rischi per la salute della madre e del bambino che derivano dalle condizioni di lavoro
italian in terzo luogo perche nella societ moderna sempre pi importante per quelli che come noi si preoccupano della realt delle persone riuscire a conciliare la vita personale con la vita professionale la famiglia con il lavoro e il settore in questione proprio uno dei pi importanti in cui tale conciliazione deve essere operata in modo responsabile
italian infine perche le politiche per la maternit devono essere coerenti con le politiche per la famiglia e per la natalit in generale ma particolarmente in un momento in cui l invecchiamento della popolazione europea richiama la crescente attenzione degli stati membri su questo tema
italian in questa sede discuteremo anche alcune modifiche la nostra posizione si ispirer all equilibrio che riteniamo sia stato raggiunto nella relazione
italian ciononostante non le appoggeremo tutte perche riteniamo che l equilibrio raggiunto nella relazione sia migliore di alcuni brani suggeriti nelle modifiche
italian sosterremo le modifiche suggerite dai nostri colleghi conservatori britannici del nostro collega bushill matthews che richiama l attenzione sulla questione delle piccole e medie imprese che crediamo debbano essere prese in considerazione nella regolamentazione sia a livello comunitario che a livello nazionale
italian tuttavia in compenso gradiremmo che i conservatori britannici appoggiassero la relazione perche se vero che alcune conclusioni della presidenza portoghese richiamano l attenzione su questo desidero sottolineare che nel testo finale del consiglio di feira paragrafo si evidenzia l importanza della responsabilit sociale delle imprese
italian e questo per noi democratici cristiani e conservatori portoghesi un tema molto importante pensiamo che le imprese abbiano una responsabilit sociale
italian mi rimane da aggiungere che vorremmo che alcune votazioni venissero fatte separatamente per migliorare la relazione laddove si immagina che saranno inserite alcune cose non pertinenti
italian non pensiamo che la gravidanza sia una risorsa sociale e c anche un altro punto per il quale desidereremmo che la votazione fosse fatta separatamente sempre allo scopo di migliorare la relazione
italian infine faccio appello a tutti i democratici cristiani affinche appoggino la relazione della mia collega socialista
italian signor presidente desidero manifestare il mio disappunto per l inerzia dimostrata dalla commissione che fino a oggi non ha preso nessuna posizione in merito alla revisione valutazione e diffusione della direttiva sulla tutela della maternit
italian al di l di tutto al di l dei notevoli danni per la donna madre derivanti da questa omissione non tutti i mali vengono per nuocere e la relazione brillantemente redatta dalla collega dami o ne un esempio poiche ha permesso al parlamento europeo di poter andare oltre
italian la relazione chiarisce concetti armonizza norme a livello comunitario crea responsabilit ripartite tiene conto dei nuovi rischi derivanti all attuale organizzazione del lavoro fornisce incentivi all aumento demografico in un europa invecchiata e considera la gravidanza uno stato naturale della madre che va rispettato e protetto
italian esplicita i diritti delle lavoratrici indipendenti e impegnate nel telelavoro e mette in risalto le crescenti preoccupazioni per i casi di monoparentalit che hanno sempre maggiore rilevanza nel panorama europeo
italian l obiettivo del prolungamento del congedo di maternit a venti settimane un obiettivo ambizioso e tecnicamente raccomandato che deve essere messo in pratica in maniera graduale e per il quale ci dobbiamo preparare sotto il profilo economico ripartendo le responsabilit in modo solidale tra gli stati i datori di lavoro e i lavoratori
italian per conseguire i fini proposti inoltre essenziale incentivare maggiormente il dialogo l interconnessione e l articolazione tra operatori sanitari e quelli dell igiene e della sicurezza sul lavoro al fine di ottenere un miglior ambiente di lavoro per la donna gravida
italian per quanto riguarda i paesi candidati l unione europea deve impegnarsi per ottenere la loro solidariet in modo da svolgere nei loro confronti una rapida opera di sensibilizzazione in merito all adozione delle misure previste in questa relazione poiche l che le resistenze potranno essere maggiori e di difficile risoluzione
italian in conclusione intendo lanciare un segnale d allarme per quanto concerne il punto della relazione visto che le misure che proteggono le donne durante la maternit quali i congedi postnatali molto lunghi possono avere effetti perversi in quanto i datori di lavoro cominciano ad avere degli svantaggi nell assumere donne e preferiscono impiegare uomini
italian la commissione deve pertanto mettere in pratica un sistema di individuazione delle frodi e di applicazione di pene severe per le imprese nei casi di discriminazione di questo tipo
italian signor presidente adottare una direttiva non significa necessariamente che la realt diventa come noi vogliamo
italian questo ne un chiaro esempio
italian secondo la valutazione della commissione la situazione in termini di sicurezza e salute delle gestanti positiva tutto ci viene per dimostrato solo sulla carta ma le cose stanno davvero cos
italian non ne sono certa
italian il ritmo sul mercato del lavoro pi serrato di quanto non lo sia mai stato si richiede un efficienza elevata le donne devono lavorare come se non fossero incinte anche se lo sono
italian questo provoca stress ed nocivo sia per la madre che il per feto
italian lo sappiamo perche dimostrato dagli studi effettuati
italian il parlamento europeo in quanto legislatore e noi come rappresentanti della popolazione abbiamo il diritto di sapere se la legislazione che adottiamo funzioni nella realt
italian ritengo che questo sia un esempio del fatto che la commissione d troppa poca importanza a questo settore
italian per questo il messaggio dal parlamento alla commissione deve essere il seguente il lavoro effettuato insufficiente
italian dev essere modificato
italian dobbiamo sapere se la legislazione funziona
italian le analisi meramente giuridiche della commissione dimostrano gi che occorre una maggiore protezione
italian credo che ci sia una maggiore esigenza di sapere che cosa sia effettivamente un indennit adeguata e ci devono essere norme pi severe contro i licenziamenti durante la gravidanza
italian la commissione deve rimettersi al lavoro e deve ritornare al tavolo per presentare le proposte necessarie
italian il modello sociale europeo caratterizzato dalla presenza di un elevato livello di protezione
italian deve essere un settor e lo dico rivolgendomi gruppo eldr che ha assunto una posizione molto divers nel quale l unione europea deve esercitare una forte influenza
italian l azione non deve essere delegata ai singoli stati membri
italian la partecipazione delle donne al mercato del lavoro un presupposto necessario per realizzare gli obiettivi ambiziosi che ci siamo prefissi in materia di occupazione e modernizzazione del modello sociale europeo
italian per questo la modernizzazione e l impegno in tale settore sono fondamentali e non possono essere delegati agli stati membri l europa che deve occuparsene
italian signor presidente molte donne sono oggi discriminate sul posto di lavoro
italian sappiamo che molte vengono licenziate quando rimangono incinte
italian questo totalmente inammissibile
italian la relazione dami o contiene molte buone proposte ma noi liberali svedesi avanziamo alcune riserve di principio sulla relazione
italian all oratore che mi ha appena preceduto desidero dire che il parlamento dovrebbe porsi pi spesso l interrogativo di che cosa deve occuparsi un parlamento europeo
italian a quale livello di dettaglio opportuno scendere
italian noi crediamo al principio di sussidiariet ossia al concetto che le decisioni vadano prese il pi possibile vicino alle persone interessate
italian la politica sociale un settore in cui l unione europea dovrebbe avere competenze limitate tranne quando si parla di libera circolazione dei cittadini all interno dell unione
italian ogni stato membro dovrebbe essere pienamente responsabile e avere il pieno diritto di decidere del rispettivo stato sociale
italian noi non crediamo in una dettagliata legislazione comune europea in campo sociale
italian ci non impedisce che gli stati membri possano coordinarsi e scambiare idee in ambito sociale
italian nella relazione dami o sono prese in esame alcune legittime rivendicazioni per una migliore sicurezza delle lavoratrici di tutta europa per una migliore mobilit e per un mercato interno meglio funzionante e viene altres rivendicato il diritto all autodeterminazione per quanto riguarda i dettagli delle varie politiche sociali nazionali
italian a tale riguardo la relazione squilibrata
italian la mia domanda conclusiva perche il parlamento europeo dovrebbe decidere che ogni donna in tutta europa debba prendersi otto settimane di permesso dopo il parto
italian conosco diverse donne che sono volute tornare al lavoro prima di questo termine la libert di scelta va tutelata
italian signor presidente giusta la critica che la onorevole dami o autrice di questa relazione muove nei confronti della commissione per il ritardo registrato nel processo di revisione della direttiva in questione
italian e positivo che la relazione lamenti il fatto che la commissione non abbia rispettato il calendario definito dalla direttiva e che non sia stata effettuata la valutazione di efficacia della sua pratica ponendo l accento sulla necessit di una proposta per la revisione urgente per la quale suggerisce l introduzione di varie misure che essenzialmente appoggiamo e con le quali siamo d accordo
italian durante il dibattito in seno alle commissioni parlamentari abbiamo presentato diverse proposte al fine di garantire il diritto obbligatorio agli intervalli durante il lavoro per consentire l allattamento il diritto alla non discriminazione sul lavor segnatamente in termini salarial delle lavoratrici gestanti puerpere o in periodo di allattamento il diritto di avanzamento nella carriera nonche il diritto di assunzione richiamando l attenzione in particolare sulla situazione delle lavoratrici con contratti a termine o atipici
italian in linea di massima tutte le proposte sono state accettate ad eccezione di quella che si riferiva al pagamento dell indennit durante la sospensione dell attivit e del congedo di maternit che dovrebbe corrispondere al per cento del salario precedente ed essere preso in considerazione per effetto dell acquisizione dei diritti pensionistici
italian auspico che il parlamento approvi la proposta
italian signor presidente se l intento della commissione sull argomento era quello di migliorare effettivamente la sicurezza e la salute delle lavoratrici gestanti o puerpere possiamo dire che essa non ha centrato il suo scopo
italian sono due infatti le evidenti lacune della sua relazione la tardivit e la limitazione
italian la relazione avrebbe dovuto trovare luce gi nel ma se pur tardiva avrebbe dovuto almeno porre rimedio alla formulazione poco chiara di alcuni articoli della direttiva nonche definire i tanti indeterminati concetti che hanno suscitato molteplici interpretazioni senza parlare tra i vari dati utili assenti delle risultanze dei questionari inviati agli stati membri nonche dei risultati del coordinamento legislativo e delle attivit in merito da parte del centro europeo di normalizzazione
italian gi nel il parlamento europeo riteneva necessaria la revisione di quella direttiva perci oggi data la necessit di un economia sociale di mercato sono condivisi gli obiettivi della relazione della collega dami o legare le politiche per la maternit alla politica della famiglia ed eliminare le indeterminazioni dando un concreto quantificato miglioramento ai diritti delle lavoratrici gestanti e puerpere
italian signor presidente signora vicepresidente della commissione l inserimento della donna nel mercato del lavoro fa s che ad un certo momento la sua vita lavorativa venga a coincidere con una gravidanza il che a volte la obbliga a chiedere permessi supplementari al fine di non mettere a repentaglio ne la propria salute ne quella del bambino che porta in grembo
italian la gravidanza uno stato naturale della donna che la societ deve rispettare salvaguardare e proteggere
italian la societ deve tutelare in particolare la donna lavoratrice facilitando la sua permanenza sul posto di lavoro
italian l inserimento della donna nel mondo del lavoro una realt irreversibile e le donne non devono essere messe nella situazione di dover scegliere tra avere figli o mantenere il posto di lavoro a causa delle complicazioni a cui una gravidanza potrebbe dar luogo
italian l invecchiamento della popolazione unito al basso tasso di natalit nell unione europea fa s che questo sia un argomento di enorme importanza per tutte le parti sociali
italian tanto importante quanto la tutela della donna gestante agevolare l allattamento materno che va a beneficio della salute sia della madre sia del bambino
italian proteggere la maternit e l allattamento materno non pu essere considerata una disparit di trattamento tra uomini e donne dato che la maternit esclusiva delle donne ed la donna che va protetta indipendentemente dal fatto che anche gli uomini possano beneficiare del congedo di paternit
italian gli stati membri devono accogliere gli eventuali effetti negativi della direttiva facilitando per gli imprenditori l assunzione di donne giovani ed esonerandoli dal pagamento degli oneri sociali durante il congedo di maternit
italian la direttiva deve includere un permesso minimo di settimane con un periodo obbligatorio di almeno otto settimane dopo il parto
italian va garantito uno stipendio minimo pari all percento dello stipendio precedente senza alcuna perdita dei diritti pensionistici
italian il divieto di licenziamento durante la gravidanza dev essere osservato in modo rigoroso
italian la gravidanza non dev essere in nessun caso motivo di discriminazione nei confronti della donna
italian la commissione per i diritti della donna e le pari opportunit deplora in modo unanime attraverso il parere presentato il ritardo con cui ha operato la commissione tale ritardo appare ancor pi grave alla luce del fatto che copre il periodo dal al vale a dire una fase in cui si sono verificati i maggiori cambiamenti per quanto riguarda l entrata della donna nel mondo del lavoro
italian inoltre riteniamo che questa mancanza normativa favorisca un fenomeno molto grave che si sta verificando fra i giovani vale a dire la rinuncia alla maternit
italian chiediamo alla commissione che prima della fine del presenti una proposta di modifica della direttiva cee e che tale direttiva possa essere applicata a tutte le lavoratrici gestanti in tutti i campi e mansioni senza eccezioni ne condizioni
italian la nuova normativa deve essere chiara e innovativa
italian deve contemplare i casi di nuove situazioni lavorative e anche la nuova situazione familiare costituita dalle famiglie monoparentali
italian la lavoratrice gestante deve poter disporre di una tutela adeguata specifica per il suo stato ma questo non deve implicare alcuna discriminazione ne riduzione delle sue opportunit di accesso al posto di lavoro anzi
italian dobbiamo essere in grado di mettere a disposizione i mezzi adeguati affinche il periodo di allattamento sia compatibile con il lavoro
italian signor presidente oggigiorno nell europa di oggi non possibile che le donne si trovino a rinunciare a un occupazione e ancor meno alla maternit
italian signor presidente nella relazione della commissione che ho letto con grande attenzione si legge in linea generale la direttiva cee stata adeguatamente applicata dagli stati membri come dimostra lo scarso numero di denunce per violazioni dei diritti delle lavoratrici gestanti pervenute alla commissione
italian la relatrice per ha ignorato queste osservazioni considerandole irrilevanti e affermando invece che la direttiva originaria non era abbastanza audace
italian innanzitutto la relazione intende armonizzare la politica sociale in tutta l unione europea anziche lasciare agli stati membri il compito di definirne i dettagl questo particolare stato sottolineato con grande vigore dall onorevole olle schmidt nell odierno dibattito
italian in secondo luogo la relazione vorrebbe migliorare le condizioni occupazionali delle lavoratrici gestanti e puerpere con la concessione di congedi di maternit supplementari e salari minimi garantiti ne l una ne l altra di queste proposte rientrano nel campo della salute e della sicurezza la relatrice propone soluzioni ad un problema che non riguarda ne la salute ne la sicurezza
italian come conservatori britannici confermiamo il nostro impegno a favore della salute e della sicurezza di tutti i lavoratori con speciale riguardo per le categorie pi vulnerabili e ci dichiariamo ancora una volta fautori della sussidiariet in materia di condizioni occupazionali
italian ribadiamo per la nostra volont di aiutare un numero sempre maggiore di donne a entrare nel mondo del lavoro senza erigere invece ulteriori barriere all occupazione femminile
italian invitiamo quindi l assemblea a respingere la relazione
italian signor presidente il testo importante nella misura in cui la legislazione interessata ha ripercussioni non trascurabili sul benessere delle donne e dei bambini vale a dire sul futuro della nostra societ
italian e sorprendente che la commissione abbia atteso cos a lungo prima di presentare al parlamento la relazione di valutazione sull applicazione della direttiva e alcune proposte volte a migliorare le condizioni di accesso al congedo di maternit
italian ho l impressione che nella proposta di revisione della direttiva che chiediamo alla commissione di presentare rapidamente sia essenziale preservare la realt di tre principi fondamentali per la donna ed il suo sviluppo il divieto di licenziamento durante la gravidanza o il congedo di maternit il diritto ad un congedo minimo obbligatorio remunerato e la contabilizzazione ai fini pensionistici di tale congedo
italian mi pare peraltro che la nuova direttiva dovrebbe comportare sostanziali miglioramenti in modo particolare la possibilit offerta a tutte le donne di beneficiare di un congedo di maternit di venti settimane senza obbligo di usufruirne integralmente ma con l obbligo per il datore di lavoro di proporlo e con un obbligo minimo di otto settimane dopo il parto per favorire lo sviluppo del legame madre figlio
italian per quanto riguarda le gravidanze a rischio e la nascita di bambini disabili evidente che andranno elaborate proposte che prevedano tenuto conto delle specificit una maggiore durata del periodo di astensione per maternit
italian in merito alla definizione dell importo sembra che la cifra da prendere in considerazione debba corrispondere quanto meno all percento della retribuzione precedente compresa la maturazione dei diritti pensionistici
italian e infine auspicabile che il testo rafforzi contemporaneamente il divieto formale di licenziamento durante la gravidanza ed il congedo di maternit
italian signor presidente mi complimento con la relatrice per il lavoro svolto a salvaguardia della donna in un momento particolare della sua vita quale quello della gravidanza e della maternit
italian rappresenta certo un passo avanti non solo a favore della donna in generale ma tutela il diritto di famiglia e ne difende i valori fondamentali
italian il partito popolare europeo ha sempre ritenuto che il concetto di famiglia inteso come nucleo fondamentale della societ sia la base per la costruzione europea e i valori cristiani cui si ispira ne impongono il rispetto
italian in un momento poi in cui l europa presenta problemi demografici necessario che le istituzioni diano un segnale forte nel rassicurare le donne che lavorano le quali devono avere la serenit sufficiente e le garanzie necessarie per scegliere di essere madri
italian ecco perche necessario disporre di un periodo adeguato di astensione dal lavoro prima del parto e ancor pi dopo in presenza di un bambino da allattare da crescere e da educare
italian l indennit quindi in questo periodo non deve subire particolari decurtazioni e tanto meno pu soffrire il trattamento pensionistico
italian aggiungo che nella fattispecie vanno garantite anche le lavoratrici autonome mediante un diritto all indennit la cui copertura da costituirsi con fondi nazionali settoriali a base contributiva
italian esprimo infine il mio accordo nel sostenere il divieto di licenziamento della donna durante questo periodo unitamente al fatto che i costi derivanti dalle indennit destinate a una lavoratrice in maternit non gravino direttamente sull azienda privata ove essa lavora ma siano assunti per intero dall istituzione pubblica e ci al fine di evitare penalizzazioni della donna sul mercato del lavoro e fatti discriminatori
italian onorevoli deputati vi chiedo di fare silenzio non pretendo un religioso silenzio ma il silenzio che si conviene a questa sede per poter ascoltare con attenzione il commissario signora de palacio
italian es signor presidente in primo luogo desidero ringraziare la onorevole dami o per la bellissima relazione che ha presentato anche se contiene una serie di critiche nei confronti del lavoro della commissione
italian ritengo di dover accettare le critiche in quanto sono certa che si basano su fatti concreti
italian ritengo anche per di dover dare una giustificazione e una spiegazione
italian per preparare il suo testo la commissione ha dovuto basarsi sulla documentazione fornita dai diversi stati e purtroppo tale documentazione non stata consegnata con la celerit e la disponibilit che la commissione si aspettava
italian questo spiega il ritardo con cui la relazione stata pubblicata
italian la commissione condivide pienamente l interesse del parlamento per il miglioramento della tutela delle lavoratrici gestanti e puerpere
italian la legislazione comunitaria e la giurisprudenza della corte di giustizia europea non offrono ancora una struttura sufficiente anche se senza dubbio costituiscono elementi chiave per poter continuare a progredire in questo aspetto essenziale della garanzia dei diritti alle lavoratrici gestanti
italian la direttiva fu adottata prima del trattato di amsterdam
italian riteniamo che adesso dopo il trattato potremo spingerci ancora pi in l e fare qualche passo avanti
italian questo quello che ci proponiamo e per questo prepareremo una relazione complementare sull applicazione di questa direttiva che verr presentata nel
italian come ben sapete onorevoli deputati la settimana scorsa la commissione ha approvato la nuova agenda sulla politica sociale per il periodo ed in questo ambito che speriamo di dare una soluzione adeguata non solo a questo problema concreto ma anche a tutta una serie di altre questioni
italian signor presidente questa l ultima volta nel corso della settimana in cui siamo presenti in gran numero in quest aula
italian desidero richiamare l attenzione sua e degli onorevoli colleghi su un fatto alquanto spiacevole
italian il parlamento gode di un ottima reputazione presso la stampa perche riuscito per vent anni a emettere due volte al giorno un comunicato destinato alla stampa scritta
italian il sistema adesso stato modificato
italian ho appena verificato come ha funzionato questa settimana
italian il comunicato stampa relativo alla commemorazione dell ex presidente pflimlin stato divulgato appena alle di luned
italian la relazione sul vertice di feira stata resa pubblica marted mattina la relazione sulla seduta in materia di discarico di marted mattina stata pubblicata alle la relazione sullo zimbabwe di marted pomeriggio stata divulgata alle la relazione sulla bce di mercoled mattina stata diffusa alle di quello stesso giorno
italian ci fa s che la stampa non tragga alcun beneficio da questo tipo di resocontazione
italian infatti a quell ora le redazioni sono gi chiuse e si offrono notizie vecchie
italian signor presidente la invito a ripristinare il vecchio sistema e a far s che le relazioni e i comunicati stampa quotidiani non solo vengano pubblicati per tempo ma forniscano anche una panoramica completa e decentrata in base alla lingua
italian la esorto a chiedere all ufficio di presidenza di riflettere seriamente al riguardo e di ritornare su una decisione assunta in precedenza
italian onorevole collega le sue osservazioni saranno naturalmente comunicate ai nostri servizi in modo che possiamo fare il nostro lavoro nel miglior modo possibile
italian signor presidente un richiamo al regolamento so benissimo che l ordine del giorno prevede un gran numero di votazioni e mi dispiace di ritardare i lavori del parlamento
italian ho appena scoperto per che la votazione sulla mia relazione sar l ultima vorrei dire che non sono stato consultato in proposito
italian anzi in precedenza ho fatto notare che la votazione dovrebbe aver luogo quanto prima visto che ho un unico volo per tornare a cas ed essendo un esperto del settore dell aviazione sono consapevole pi di chiunque altro del problema
italian mi trovo perci bloccato qui
italian mi affido alla clemenza dell assemblea sarebbe possibile anticipare la votazione sulla relazione atkins
italian prendo atto della sua richiesta
italian signor presidente nel caso lei accolga la richiesta del collega propongo che almeno l ordine di votazione sia fissato cos come deciso ieri
italian sarebbe un altra cosa
italian onorevole mombaur io non ho accolto la richiesta dell onorevole atkins l ho semplicemente registrata
italian c un determinato ordine di votazione che seguir e mi dispiace se alcune di queste relazioni non saranno votate stamattina ma nel pomeriggio
italian passiamo ora alle votazioni
italian votazioni
italian signor presidente come ha gi rilevato la votazione riguarda proposte di compromesso che sono state definite nell ambito di una concertazione informale con la commissione
italian il maggio abbiamo rinviato la relazione alla quale nel frattempo abbiamo apportato miglioramenti
italian con questa procedura il parlamento ha dimostrato nuovamente alla commissione la propria volont di avere pieno potere di codecisione anche a livello di commissione per l agricoltura e nel settore agricolo e proprio la procedura seguita in questa vicenda ci ha permesso di ottenere ci che volevamo
italian ringrazio la commissione per la collaborazione ed esprimo l auspicio che la commissione difenda ora di fronte al consiglio i compromessi raggiunti in modo che essi possano essere respinti soltanto all unanimit
italian la commissione e il parlamento agendo di comune intesa hanno conquistato una posizione di forza e mi auguro che questa esperienza possa fungere da esempio anche per la conferenza intergovernativa di nizza
italian signor presidente signora commissario onorevoli colleghi desidero esprimere la mia sincera e sentita gratitudine non solo alla commissione ma anche a tutti i collaboratori e a tutti i colleghi della commissione per l agricoltura per essere riusciti a raggiungere insieme questo compromesso
italian vi chiedo di approvare oggi il dossier poiche in caso contrario il consiglio del e luglio sarebbe nella condizione di prendere una decisione in assenza di un parere del parlamento non avendo noi tenuto fede secondo una sentenza della corte di giustizia europea al nostro dovere di collaborare in modo leale e disponibile
italian per questo motivo vi invito ad approvare oggi il dossier in esame
italian rinnovo i miei ringraziamenti per la collaborazione
italian signora commissario vuole rispondere alla domanda del collega
italian signor presidente onorevoli deputati far alcune brevi osservazioni
italian posso confermare che la commissione accoglie dodici dei tredici emendamenti di compromesso presentati
italian peraltro la commissione nutre alcune riserve sulla formulazione legislativa e sull inserimento degli emendamenti nel testo mentre per quanto concerne il contenuto la commissione appogger senz altro le proposte di compromesso durante la discussione con il consiglio in merito all emendamento n
italian vorrei rilevare che i trasferimenti volontari di quote da uno stato membro ad un altro possono essere eseguiti una volta soltanto poiche altrimenti si verificherebbero facilmente distorsioni nel sistema di ripartizione riguardo all emendamento n
italian la commissione prende atto della preoccupazione manifestata dalla commissione sul livello degli aiuti per la coltivazione di piante a fibra lunga nel contempo per non pu che far presente ancora una volta che le possibilit di valutazione sono limitate se si chiede la presentazione di una relazione gi dopo il primo anno della riforma
italian infine a nome del mio collega commissario fischler e della commissione tutta desidero ringraziare il parlamento per la collaborazione
italian ritengo che le proposte di compromesso che sono state elaborate abbiano contribuito non solo ad un miglioramento ma anche e soprattutto all ulteriore sviluppo di questo dossier

italian signor presidente onorevoli colleghi mi rincresce di dover intervenire sulla relazione dell onorevole kuhne ma si tratta di una vicenda assai complessa
italian in questa relazione che come tutti sanno riguarda la concessione del discarico sull esecuzione del bilancio del parlamento per l esercizio ci sono un punto e un trattino
italian il trattino si occupa del nostro gruppo
italian i presidenti dei gruppi avevano concordat e tutti i presidenti lo possono confermar che nella relazione non sarebbero stati affrontati casi concreti relativi a singoli gruppi e che eventuali problemi sarebbero stati affrontati insieme anche in futuro
italian dopo aver rilevato che questa formulazione ripresa tale e quale nella relazione a nome del mio gruppo ho presentato una proposta di compromesso che come mi stato comunicato qualche giorno fa avrebbe incontrato il favore del relatore
italian successivamente abbiamo rinunciato a presentare una proposta che riguarda i problemi del gruppo pse
italian ora apprendo che il gruppo pse non intende appoggiare il nostro emendamento n che porta il mio nome
italian dichiaro in questa sede con molta chiarezza e con grande seriet nonche con notevole rincrescimento che l accordo concluso tra i presidenti dei gruppi stato tradito
italian e stata tradita la correttezza
italian dichiaro altres che il nostro gruppo si sente preso in giro e parlo non solo a titolo personale bens a nome dell intero gruppo
italian se il gruppo pse non voter a favore dell emendamento n e questo un suo problema mi permetto di rilevare che la decisione che il gruppo pse prender oggi sar una decisione molto pesante
italian applausi dai banchi del gruppo ppe de
italian onorevole poettering come lei sa le dichiarazioni di voto si fanno dopo le votazioni
italian ora non possiamo aprire un dibattito anche se il soggetto molto delicato
italian signor presidente ho constatato che la legge non uguale per tutti volevo fare un intervento sulla stessa linea in occasione dell assemblea plenaria precedente sulla risoluzione su feira ma non mi concessero l autorizzazione di farlo e perci intervenni in un altro momento alla fine
italian ricordo che ci fu una protesta generale fra quei seggi affinche si rispettasse il regolamento oggi non stato cos
italian quello che voglio sottolineare a nome del mio gruppo che assolutamente inammissibile in primo luogo che si citi un accordo che non esiste in secondo luogo che si minacci il mio gruppo
italian non ha senso condizionare il voto degli altri
italian accetto il fatto che uno possa difendere le proprie posizioni quello che non si pu accettare che a questo punto prima della votazione si minacci il mio gruppo riguardo un tema che stato votato dalla commissione per il controllo dei bilanci con i voti tra l altro anche dei deputati di quei seggi
italian inoltr e con questo concludo signor president stato detto che nella relazione kuhne non si fa menzione di alcun gruppo
italian consiglio all onorevole poettering di leggere attentamente la relazione
italian applausi del gruppo pse
italian signor presidente nella mia veste di relatore desidero fare qualche breve osservazione
italian la prima di carattere generale
italian ritengo che sarebbe bene se in questo parlamento ci abituassimo in futuro a non sentire violata la nostra sensibilit durante le procedure di discarico del bilancio soltanto quando sono in gioco i nostri comportamenti
italian seconda osservazione nella mia relazione originaria approvata dalla commissione in marzo e sottoposta al voto dell assemblea in aprile avevo proposto di affrontare nella relazione un problema che riguarda il mio gruppo
italian a suo tempo in sede di commissione il mio gruppo e il gruppo verts ale avevano deciso di risolvere tale problema che riguarda il pagamento di funzionari del partito con fondi riservati al gruppo
italian con una maggioranza di voti espressa dai gruppi ppe de ed eldr la mia richiesta fu depennata dalla proposta di relazione
italian se l onorevole poettering non era gi a conoscenza di questa circostanza pu prenderne atto adesso
italian mi sia concessa un osservazione di principio in quanto relatore per la procedura di discarico
italian il discarico per l esecuzione del bilancio del parlamento stato collegato alla questione delle finanze dei gruppi a seguito di una proposta in tal senso presentata nel mese di aprile dall onorevole elles a nome del gruppo ppe de
italian quella che avete portato avanti era una proposta vostra del vostro stesso gruppo
italian ed in base proprio a questa proposta che la relazione contiene il punto da voi contestato
italian allora fu fatto esplicito riferimento alla relazione della corte dei conti
italian a nessun relatore per una procedura di discarico in cui siano coinvolti i gruppi pu essere negato il discarico in forza di un accordo tra i presidenti dei gruppi che tale accordo esista o meno
italian richiamarsi al fatto che i presidenti dei gruppi si autoconcedano il discarico di per se un fatto che merita ulteriori approfondimenti
italian un ultima osservazione sul carattere di compromesso
italian e successo pi di una volta che qualcuno abbia dichiarato come compromesso una propria proposta
italian nessuno in nessun momento venuto da me per discutere se questo sia o meno un compromesso
italian mi stato chiesto semplicemente se potevo accettare la proposta ed io ho risposto di no perche non crea affatto maggiore trasparenza nella questione in gioco per tale motivo continuo ad essere contrario alla proposta
italian applausi

italian gli emendamenti nn e mirano ad abolire l obbligo di indicare sulle etichette la categoria dell animale
italian ci sono gi state discussioni sulla definizione della categoria degli animali in sede di comitato amministrativo e la commissione fiduciosa che si troveranno soluzioni tali da soddisfare la maggioranza degli stati membri se non addirittura tutti
italian la commissione ritiene pertanto che sia fondamentale far entrare in vigore le disposizioni sull etichettatura il o settembre
italian se si riaprisse l intera discussione si farebbe slittare l entrata in vigore delle norme
italian di conseguenza gli emendamenti non possono essere accolti
italian sull emendamento n la commissione giunta alla conclusione che la proposta di regolamento assicuri gi la piena sicurezza sull origine dei prodotti

italian di conseguenza se si voleva trattarle tutte allo stesso modo avremmo dovuto votare ben oltre le cosa che non possiamo fare
italian eppoi si vota normalmente quando c un aula disponibile a farlo non quando c una situazione di indisponibilit
italian termina qui il turno di votazioni
italian dichiarazioni di voto
italian signor presidente per quanto riguarda la votazione sulla relazione papayannakis chiedo alla commissione di convocare un comitato di conciliazione per la settimana prossima in modo da risolvere la questione prima della scadenza del settembre
italian la prego di informare la signora commissario visto che in questo momento non sta ascoltando
italian relazione schierhuber a
italian esistono gravi riserve in merito alla proposta di regolamento ce concernente il lino e la canapa destinati alla produzione di fibre in quanto la ripartizione delle quote tra gli stati membri sproporzionata
italian paesi come la grecia aventi un settore agricolo rilevante ed un elevata percentuale di occupati in lavori agricoli hanno a disposizione quote inferiori per quanto riguarda sia il lino che la canapa
italian colgo l occasione per sottolineare che necessaria una campagna d informazione negli stati membri in modo da arginare la demagogia e l ignoranza circa la canapa tessile che nel caso della grecia hanno portato alla chiusura da parte della polizia di negozi che vendevano tessuti di canapa nonche alla rovina di piccole imprese
italian relazione stauner a
italian signor presidente i pensionati come gli anziani sono favorevoli alle novit anche se qualcuno potrebbe pensare il contrario e quindi ogni occasione nella quale nel decidere sui fondi strutturali si inseriscono delle regole affinche ci siano delle azioni innovative non pu che trovarmi favorevole quale rappresentante del partito dei pensionati
italian in questa occasion e lo faccio volentier auspico dopo aver spiegato ovviamente che ho votato a favore che in futuro si inseriscano tra i progetti da finanziare come azioni innovative anche progetti che si rivolgono non soltanto al miglioramento dell attivit lavorativa in senso stretto ma anche a tutto quanto riguarda i pensionati i quali godono nel loro periodo di assenza di attivit lavorativa della contribuzione versata in occasione di lavoro periodo che in senso lato un continuamento dell attivit lavorativa
italian relazione virrankoski a
italian signor presidente intervengo semplicemente per dire che i deputati radicali si sono astenuti su questo voto della relazione virrankoski perche il consiglio ha voluto accaparrare a se al bilancio del consiglio anche le spese derivanti dalle missioni che esperti militari o altri potrebbero essere condotti a fare nel quadro della pesc
italian poiche il nostro parlamento stato sempre molto vigilante a che le spese relative alla pesc siano parte integrante del bilancio dell unione e quindi rientrino nel bilancio della commissione noi siamo preoccupati dalla deriva che pu giungere dalla relazione virrankoski dalla tendenza cio a mettere sempre pi nel bilancio del consiglio spese di funzionamento spese operative per quanto riguarda la pesc
italian e per questo che ci siamo astenuti sulla relazione virrankoski
italian abbiamo votato contro la concessione di fondi supplementari ai consiglieri militari perche crediamo che una politica di pace abbia bisogno di esperti di pace e di una risoluzione non violenta del conflitto
italian relazione stauner a
italian signor presidente ritengo che il parlamento non possa accontentarsi di quanto ha ottenuto finora
italian concedendo il discarico alla commissione corre il rischio di perdere credibilit nel settore del controllo dei bilanci e della lotta contro le frodi
italian mi chiedo se l assemblea sia realmente consapevole del fatto che accordando il discarico si assume la responsabilit per i danni conseguenti
italian sar difficile spiegare ai cittadini europei che nel caso flechard sono stati insabbiati milioni di euro versati da loro stessi in quanto contribuenti e che il parlamento si accontenta di vuote promesse
italian tutti coloro che in quest aula hanno votato a favore del discarico del bilancio della commissione si sono cos assunti personalmente la responsabilit di quei fatti
italian non c da meravigliarsi se i cittadini nutrono sempre meno fiducia nell europa
italian a nome del mio gruppo dichiaro che per il motivo esposto abbiamo votato contro il discarico alla commissione
italian i membri del gruppo uen hanno espresso voto contrario in occasione della votazione del luglio sul discarico per l esecuzione del bilancio generale dell unione europea per l esercizio
italian il motivo che l attuale commissione che si impegnata ad attuare una radicale riforma amministrativa non d prova di sufficiente volont di portare a termine tale riforma
italian i numerosi esempi di riluttanza ritardi e rifiuti di consegnare documenti alla commissione per il controllo dei bilanci unitamente al fatto inaudito che relazioni e verbali di primaria importanza spariscono dagli archivi dove dovrebbero stare sono spiacevoli conferme del fatto che si continua a mantenere una gestione tipica dell epoca dell assolutismo
italian e palese che la chiusura ha lo scopo di proteggere i membri e i funzionari della commissione dalle sanzioni che si applicano in qualsiasi amministrazione nazionale democratica e senza le quali l amministrazione dell unione europea non potr mai funzionare
italian durante la discussione sulla relazione ho citato due delle questioni ancora aperte ma sono solo i sintomi di una malattia
italian ad un anno dal suo insediamento la commissione non ha ancora presentato alcuna proposta di modifica sostanziale delle disposizioni dello statuto dei funzionari che garantiscono una protezione giuridica dell incapacit e della disonesta e che sono assolutamente assurde in un amministrazione che asserisce di essere democratica
italian la discussione di questa relazione in seno alla commissione per il controllo dei bilanci ha gi dimostrato che alcuni deputati del parlamento sono pi impegnati nel proteggere la commissione dai cittadini che finanziano il bilancio dell unione europea che a difendere il diritto di questi stessi cittadini ad una gestione onesta ed efficiente del loro denaro
italian viene esercitata una pressione inaccettabile su molti relatori e quei gruppi disonesti che hanno interesse ad ostacolare il chiarimento e la risoluzione di gravi casi di frode e truffa nell amministrazione della commissione non hanno esitato ad arrivare alle minacce fisiche
italian oggi la maggioranza dei deputati del parlamento ha votato a favore del discarico
italian non credo che molti di questi deputati siano soddisfatti della gestione economica della commissione ma siamo arrivati al punto in cui la maggioranza preferisce chiudere gli occhi piuttosto che rischiare che i propri cittadini ed elettori ottengano informazioni esaurienti sulle situazioni scandalose che si ripetono anno dopo anno
italian sono convinto che la maggioranza dei deputati finir a lungo andare col rimpiangere la propria indulgenza
italian il giugno nella mia qualit di relatrice ho raccomandato alla commissione per il controllo dei bilanci la concessione del discarico per l esecuzione del bilancio della commissione relativo all esercizio
italian oggi ho votato contro la concessione del discarico
italian il motivo determinante stato il comportamento tenuto dal commissario competente per i bilanci nel caso flechard una societ sospettata di frode gi dal
italian nonostante i sospetti a questa societ stata condonata una penale di milioni di euro nonostante i sospetti in tutti questi anni la commissione ha continuato tranquillamente a fare affari con detta societ senza chiederle nessuna spiegazione
italian ora la guardia di finanza italiana sta conducendo delle indagini e corre voce che la flechard sia coinvolta in traffici illeciti e adulterazioni aventi come oggetto il burro
italian non sicuramente corretto emettere condanne a priori tuttavia il commissario competente per i bilanci non ha il diritto di rifiutarsi di dire quanti milioni la commissione abbia pagato negli anni scorsi alla societ in questione
italian il maggio il commissario signora schreyer aveva promesso di comunicare tali cifre alla commissione per il controllo dei bilanci ma non lo ha ancora fatto ricorrendo a sempre nuove scuse
italian marted scorso in questa sede ci ha voluto far credere asserendo il falso di non poter fornire quelle cifre perche lo impedirebbe il regolamento n
italian il bilancio della comunit non un bilancio segreto
italian se la commissione si rifiuta di render conto dei suoi atti non possiamo che reagire rifiutando la concessione del discarico
italian e tutt altro che scontato concedere il discarico alla commissione europea
italian negli anni passati le irregolarit finanziarie sono state tali da costringerci a negare il discarico e ci ha portato alle dimissioni della commissione santer
italian questa volta ci occupiamo dell esercizio e la valutazione estremamente difficile
italian la responsabilit tutta della commissione precedente ma ne stiamo discutendo con l attuale commissione prodi che ha dato avvio ad una gestione pi corretta e ad un indagine sulle frodi commesse in passato
italian nella primavera di quest anno il parlamento ha giustamente rinviato la concessione del discarico per l esercizio al fine di ottenere maggiori chiarimenti e miglioramenti
italian tali miglioramenti in gran parte sono stati promessi anche se una percentuale di errori gravi superiore al percento spaventosamente elevata
italian il fatto che la relazione sulla riunione della commissione in cui stata ridotta all osso la multa per l affaire flechard sia introvabile non altro che una presa in giro
italian la commissione per il controllo dei bilanci stata dibattuta tra un giudizio severo e il beneficio del dubbio
italian quanto accaduto per ci che concerne la motivazione del relatore pu essere definito vergognoso e rovina la reputazione della commissione
italian in relazione alla valutazione finale se concedere o meno il discarico abbiamo concesso all odierna commissione il beneficio del dubbio per quanto riguarda il
italian la commissione deve rendersi conto che ci non crea un precedente per il discarico per l esercizio in considerazione del fatto che per esso in parte personalmente responsabile e che inoltre nel frattempo ha avuto modo di mettere la situazione a posto
italian l onorevole redondo mi ha chiesto la parola per una questione di procedura
italian signor presidente vorrei chiedere che la votazione sulla relazione relativa alla protezione dei boschi venga rimandata alla prossima sessione in quanto oggi per questioni inderogabili devo lasciare l aula alle
italian onorevole redondo ci sono diverse relazioni di carattere legislativo che non abbiamo potuto mettere in votazione perche non c era assolutamente tempo e che di conseguenza saranno messe in votazione oggi pomeriggio al termine del turno di votazione delle urgenze come sempre
italian come lei sa determinate decisioni vengono prese dalla conferenza dei presidenti
italian normalmente quando cominciamo a votare a mezzogiorno lo facciamo per un ora
italian oggi abbiamo iniziato alle e abbiamo terminato di votare verso le il tempo per votare alcune risoluzioni come il consiglio europeo di feira lo zimbabwe e la tratta degli esseri umani era un tempo relativamente breve
italian il voto per i progetti legislativi relativamente lungo
italian in ogni caso non un tema da riprendere ora
italian terremo conto della sua osservazione e la faremo conoscere alla conferenza dei presidenti perche nell ordine delle votazioni cos come abbiamo votato tutti gli esami in seconda lettur che sono un elemento che riguarda la nostra capacit di assemblea legislativ si votano anche nell ordine dei progetti che sono relativi al nostro potere di colegislazione
italian voglia scusarmi signor presidente se riprendo il punto su cui ho concluso il mio intervento precedente e se mi riallaccio a quanto teste detto dall onorevole swoboda
italian signor presidente ho ben compreso tutte le sue argomentazioni per questa settimana per la prima volta non abbiamo avuto alcuna votazione nel giorno di marted
italian e stato deciso cos
italian noi eravamo contrari ma credo che anche la maggioranza del parlament se lo avesse saput e i relator la onorevole redondo jimenez o l onorevole arvidsson e altr sarebbero stati sicuramente contrari
italian se prendiamo una decisione del genere dobbiamo dar prova di una certa dose di flessibilit
italian in questa cerchia un po ristretta mi permetto di rilevare che la maggior parte di noi sono parlamentari esperti e sappiamo bene che non tutte le sedute sono uguali
italian la seduta di gioved della sessione di luglio una seduta altamente delicata
italian lo sappiamo non sar bello per cos
italian la prego quindi di verificare se i quattro progetti legislativi che sono ancora all ordine del giorno e sui quali si pu votare senza impiegare troppo tempo possono essere aggiornati alla prossima seduta
italian la stessa onorevole redondo jimenez lo ha chiesto per la sua relazione ed io appoggio senz altro tale richiesta
italian credo e spero che anche l onorevole arvidsson possa essere d accordo per quanto riguarda gli aspetti di mia conoscenza
italian la invito a mettersi in contatto con i relatori e con i gruppi
italian l onorevole swoboda ha gi detto e per parte mia posso ribadire a nome del mio gruppo che saremo favorevoli ad un rinvio della votazione su questi quattro progetti legislativi alla tornata di settembre oppure ad una seduta a bruxelles
italian onorevole roth behrendt lei sa che si pu ottenere un rinvio della discussione sia all inizio della seduta il mattino sia all inizio della votazione
italian quindi oggi pomeriggio quando inizieranno le votazioni ci sar un relatore o un collega che chieder di votare a settembre
italian su questa esigenza non ho alcuna obiezione
italian signor presidente lei ha pienamente ragione
italian quella da lei proposta senz altro la giusta procedura da seguire tuttavia per correttezza nei confronti dei relatori dovremmo informarli di questa possibilit quando si programma la seduta e quando si sa per certo che l onorevole swoboda o io o altri deputati interverranno in merito
italian in ogni caso il presidente di turno sar informato di questa richiesta e dar naturalmente la parola a un deputato che in quel momento la formalizzer
italian relazione ruhle a
italian signor presidente ho votato contro la relazione ruhle
italian in primo luogo ritengo che ci sia un errore di cifra perche si parla di bilancio nel di ben milioni di eur questo almeno nella versione italian cosa che mi sembra cos a prima vista un po troppo credo che ci sia un errore di almeno tre zeri
italian chiusa questa parentesi vorrei sottolineare che tra gli altri aspetti che come gi il relatore ha sottolineato nella sua relazione non vanno ben per cui sarebbe stato logico concludere con una richiesta di votazione contro il proprio document sarebbe opportuno che in futuro si lasciasse almeno una parte di questi fondi anche alle associazioni di volontari molti dei quali sono anziani e pensionati che sono disponibili ad andare nel mondo per aiutare lo sviluppo dei paesi che ne hanno necessit
italian giustamente durante seduta del aprile il parlamento europeo decideva di rinviare la decisione sulla concessione del discarico alla commissione europea per l esecuzione del bilancio per l esercizio
italian si trattava di una decisione legittima visto che i cittadini degli stati membri hanno il diritto di chiedere spiegazioni sul modo in cui viene speso il denaro dell unione europea il loro denaro
italian il nostro gruppo estremamente determinato a questo proposito pienamente favorevole alle misure che possono essere intraprese per la lotta contro la frode e le malversazioni
italian le irregolarit costatate quelle affrontate nella relazione stauner sulla contestabile gestione effettuata dalla commissione e quelle messe in evidenza nella relazione della onorevole ruhle sui fondi europei di sviluppo non possono lasciarci indifferenti e nuocciono all immagine e alla credibilit della comunit nel suo insieme
italian quindi onorevoli colleghi dobbiamo trarre tutte le conseguenze sia che si tratti di sanzionare i sicuri responsabili che di applicare procedure pi trasparenti
italian come si evince dai voti espressi in seno alla commissione per il controllo dei bilanci le relazioni delle onorevoli ruhle e stauner vanno crediamo in questa direzione
italian la relazione della onorevole ruhle sui fes pone la commissione di fronte alle sue responsabilit domandando maggiore chiarezza per l insieme dei futuri aiuti erogati dall unione ai paesi in via di sviluppo
italian la preoccupazione di una maggiore moralizzazione della politica degli aiuti e l efficacia del loro utilizzo un principio ormai chiaramente riconosciuto e il nostro gruppo ne soddisfatto
italian e tuttavia inaccettabile che con il pretesto di un controllo migliore mirante ad un utilizzo pi onesto e razionale dei fondi europei mi riferisco in particolare ai paesi dell africa dei caraibi e del pacific la nostra decisione diventi una scusa per organizzare altrove un processo ingiusto contro alcuni paesi dell unione attraverso una caccia alle streghe che sembra mira a colpire alcuni alti funzionari di una stessa nazionalit mi riferisco ad uno dei principali contribuenti netti la francia
italian la nostra preoccupazione principale una maggiore trasparenza sulle finanze dei gruppi politici di quest assemblea inoltre i cittadini europei non capirebbero se noi tenessimo un altro discorso
italian dobbiamo dunque prendere atto delle risposte date dalla nostra istituzione in seguito alle osservazioni della corte dei conti e incoraggiare senza indugi qualsiasi riforma pertinente in conformit con il regolamento finanziario e il principio della trasparenza
italian per concludere come sappiamo preferibile non creare confusione fra la procedura di discarico che rappresenta una valutazione globale sulla gestione della commissione europea prevista dal trattato e il disbrigo di certe questioni specifiche palesemente gravi che hanno anche un carattere specifico e importi minimi rispetto alla globalit del bilancio
italian occorre essere ragionevoli
italian inoltre prendere atto delle precisazioni supplementari che avevamo richiesto alla commissione in primavera nell ambito della relazione stauner non legittima assolutamente per il nostro gruppo il fatto che la nostra istituzione sia poi colpita da amnesia in seguito a pratiche inaccettabili e a scapito del denaro dei nostri concittadini
italian il nostro gruppo si congratula per il lavoro svolto dalle relatrici onorevoli stauner e ruhle e dall onorevole kuhne
italian tuttavia necessario rimanere vigilanti e osservare attraverso l esperienza diretta l atteggiamento della commissione europea per quanto concerne gli impegni presi
italian quindi per il momento il nostro gruppo preferisce astenersi
italian relazione kuhne a
italian ho votato contro il discarico al segretario generale perche in occasione dell acquisto dell edificio asp a bruxelles ha fornito informazioni fuorvianti agli organi competenti per la decisione
italian si fatto credere che commissione e consiglio avessero approvato un finanziamento dell edificio con l aiuto del promotore immobiliare dell epoca
italian si fatto credere inoltre che il finanziamento dell immobile con l aiuto del promotore immobiliare fosse una forma indiretta di finanziamento
italian di fatto invece nel il parlamento si indebitato direttamente per importi pari a milioni di ecu e miliardi di franchi belgi nei confronti di un consorzio di banche guidate dalla westlb senza che prima comparisse un bando sulla gazzetta ufficiale
italian secondo quanto stabilito dalla corte dei conti sono state violate anche le relative normative finanziarie
italian relazione papayannakis a
italian e servito lo scandalo della mucca pazza per rendersi conto della necessit di migliorare l identificazione e l etichettatura dei prodotti alimentari
italian l europa ha reagito molto tardi accumulando un notevole ritardo soprattutto per quel che concerne la carne bovina
italian oggi sulla base di un accordo unanime in seno al consiglio possiamo finalmente dimostrare un po di determinazione
italian la posizione comune sottopostaci riprende infatti molti degli emendamenti adottati dal nostro parlamento in prima lettura
italian per quel che concerne le diciture obbligatorie l indicazione dell origine le date della lavorazione le carni macinate e il sistema facoltativo ritengo che il parlamento possa essere soddisfatto visto che il consiglio ci ha ascoltati
italian e per questo motivo che ho sostenuto con determinazione questa posizione comune cos com e non ho votato nessun emendamento
italian il dibattito si incentrato su alcuni punti specifici e in particolare sull indicazione della categoria dell animale sull etichetta
italian alcuni parlamentari ci hanno spiegato in buona fede che tale dicitura non facilita l identificazione della carne bovina ed hanno ragione
italian tuttavia dopo il susseguirsi degli scandali alimentari sempre denunciati con forza dal nostro parlamento come potremmo oggi non tenere conto del ruolo fondamentale svolto dal consumatore
italian l indicazione esplicita della categoria risponde ad una richiesta in quanto contribuisce a restituire la fiducia ai consumatori
italian occorre distinguere fra due tipi di informazioni
italian quelle che facilitano l identificazione ma che non sono direttamente destinate ad informare il consumatore finale
italian sono infatti troppo specifiche formalmente comprensibili solo dai professionisti e svolgono una funzione di tipo sanitario
italian i controlli potranno essere effettuati sulla base di queste diciture
italian parliamo quindi dell attuazione del sistema d identificazione e dell etichettatura
italian il secondo tipo di informazioni rivolto direttamente al cittadino che come noi acquista la carne tutti i giorni
italian cosa vuole sapere
italian vuole essere sicuro che il prodotto che consumer sia sano il sistema di identificazione e di etichettatura permetter di garantire la sicurezza e la qualit della carne bovina
italian ma il cittadino desidera anche sapere di che tipo di carne si tratta
italian questo tipo di dicitura sull etichetta si rivolge direttamente al consumatore finale fornendogli un informazione intelligibile
italian e sbagliato dire che questo non serve a niente
italian al contrario questa etichettatura tanto importante quanto l attuazione di garanzie sanitarie
italian l europa deve ridare fiducia ai suoi consumatori che diffidano della carne bovina dopo lo scandalo della mucca pazza del quale tutto il settore agroalimentare violentemente colpito da questa crisi paga le conseguenze
italian questi due tipi di informazioni non sono in contrasto ma sono complementari tra loro e contribuiscono ciascuno al suo livello a riconquistare la fiducia dei consumatori europei
italian non possiamo decretare la fiducia dei nostri consumatori dobbiamo conquistarla
italian relazione garcia orcoyen tormo a
italian un corretto obiettivo politico dell unione europea quello di garantire che le imprese svolgano la propria attivit nel rispetto dell ambiente
italian il sistema comunitario di ecogestione e audit noto come emas offre alle imprese dell unione l occasione di ottenere una certificazione del fatto che svolgono la loro attivit nel rispetto dell ambiente
italian oggi discutiamo la revisione del regolamento originario del che ha istituito il sistema comunitario di ecogestione e audit
italian i criteri per l iscrizione nel registro emas sono molto rigorosi
italian in pratica vi una rendicontazione pubblica dei risultati ottenuti da ogni ente nazionale per gli standard in ogni stato membro
italian ognuno di questi enti svolge un esame completo ed esaustivo secondo il sistema emas dell impatto ambientale di tutte le attivit del potenziale candidato
italian secondo il nuovo regolamento che stiamo discutendo oggi le piccole e medie imprese potranno richiedere pi facilmente la certificazione emas che finora stata richiesta soprattutto dalle maggiori aziende industriali
italian dobbiamo ricordare che l emas la versione europea dello standard internazionale noto come iso in pratica lo standard internazionale iso l equivalente dell iso per le aziende europee elaborato per secondo un adeguato approccio ambientale
italian e perci opportuno che la politica dell unione europea in questo settore garantisca che tutte le aziende europee rispettino l ambiente e che adottino le iniziative necessarie affinche la loro attivit non eserciti alcun impatto negativo sull ambiente
italian ecco perche approvo le proposte volte ad assicurare un pi facile accesso delle pmi al sistema emas
italian tale sistema dovr divenire pi flessibile nonostante le sue norme rigorose per permettere a tutti i settori e a tutte le imprese dell unione europea di ottenere la certificazione secondo il sistema comunitario di ecogestione e audit
italian mi dichiaro a favore del programma e raccomando l approvazione della relazione
italian raccomandazione per la seconda lettura breyer a
italian signor presidente ho votato a favore di questa raccomandazione che stabilisce dei valori limite per il benzene e il monossido di carbonio nell aria ambiente
italian sono naturalmente favorevole in quanto se qualcuno viene danneggiato tra questi i primi sono sicuramente gli anziani e i pensionati che evidentemente hanno gi qualche volta i polmoni un po malandati
italian a parte questo vorrei sottolineare la mia richiesta che in futuro non ci si preoccupi solamente di quello che respirano i cittadini ma anche di quello che respirano i lavoratori che hanno a che fare ad esempio appunto con il benzene e il monossido di carbonio
italian sarebbe bene che ci interessassimo anche perche i loro orari di lavoro siano ridotti rispetto agli altri lavoratori in modo che possano usufruire della media della vita di tutti i cittadini
italian credo che l unione europea dovrebbe interessarsi particolarmente di come e quanto lavorano i cittadini che respirano quelle sostanze dannose che giustamente ci preoccupiamo di non far respirare ai pedoni
italian i lavoratori devono essere ancora pi protetti
italian raccomandazione per la seconda lettura jackson a
italian signor presidente ho votato a favore e mi congratulo con la relatrice onorevole jackson che ha tanto insistito perche si trasformasse in direttiva questa raccomandazione sull organizzazione concreta di ispezioni ambientali
italian e inutile che questo parlamento approvi centinaia e centinaia di direttive di regolamentazioni importantissime e utilissime se poi non si svolgono degli effettivi concreti e sufficienti controlli affinche tali regolamentazioni vengano realmente applicate e concretamente ci sia un beneficio per tutti i cittadini dell unione europea particolarment come ho detto poc anz quando si tratta di salute ambientale come in questo caso e quando l inosservanza delle regole porta danno soprattutto agli anziani e ai pensionati
italian l obiettivo principale della raccomandazione di favorire il rispetto della legislazione ambientale comunitaria negli stati membri e di contribuire ad una sua pi coerente applicazione
italian la proposta di raccomandazione fissa dei criteri minimi da applicare nell organizzazione nello svolgimento nel follow up e nella informazione sui risultati delle ispezioni ambientali
italian essa prevede ispezioni ambientali in tutte le aziende industriali o d altro tipo le cui emissioni e i cui scarichi nell ambiente siano soggetti ad autorizzazioni o licenze specifiche questo varrebbe certamente per tutte le aziende che ottengono licenze per il controllo dell inquinamento sotto gli auspici delle agenzie per l ambiente
italian secondo il testo di questa raccomandazione le ispezioni ambientali comprenderanno visite in sito verifica dell automonitoraggio effettuato dai gestori degli impianti controllati controllo dei locali delle attrezzature e dell adeguatezza della gestione ambientale del sito nonche degli archivi tenuti dai gestori
italian si prevedono due tipi di ispezioni quelle di routine effettuate secondo un programma ispettivo pianificato e ispezioni straordinarie in seguito a denunce relative alle licenze al loro rinnovo o alla loro modifica
italian gli stati membri dovranno elaborare preventivamente dei piani di ispezione ambientale che coprano tutto il territorio nazionale e i relativi impianti questi piani saranno a disposizione di chiunque voglia consultarli nell ambito delle pi ampie campagne informative contemplate da questa proposta
italian secondo questa proposta di raccomandazione ogni piano dovr definire la relativa area geografica coprire un periodo di tempo definito comprendere provvedimenti specifici per la sua revisione individuare i siti o i tipi di impianti di cui dovr occuparsi indicare i programmi per le ispezioni ambientali di routine prevedere e definire le procedure per le ispezioni ambientali straordinarie disporre il coordinamento fra le diverse autorit ispettive
italian vorrei congratularmi con la onorevole jackson per la sua relazione in cui chiede di tradurre la proposta in una direttiva che possa essere applicata uniformemente in tutta l unione europea
italian la relatrice ritiene infatti che soltanto una direttiva potr costringere gli stati membri a introdurre questi sistemi ispettivi
italian quale membro della commissione per l ambiente la sanit pubblica e la politica dei consumatori credo che gli stati membri debbano istituire ispezioni ambientali armonizzate
italian il consiglio deve ascoltare il parlamento europeo a questo proposito
italian noi tutti dobbiamo ricordare che il parlamento europeo ha potere di codecisione su questioni ambientali in seguito all attuazione delle disposizioni del trattato di amsterdam
italian l unione europea anche competente per le questioni ambientali ai sensi dell articolo del trattato di maastricht
italian consiglio europeo del giugno a santa maria da feira
italian in merito alla presidenza portoghese e al vertice conclusivo di santa maria da feira vorrei formulare quattro osservazioni
italian anzitutto l unione ha compiuto un ennesimo passo pericoloso verso la militarizzazione promovendo l organizzazione di una forza militare e di polizia dell unione e lo sviluppo dell ambito atlantico entro cui operer detta forza
italian sono invece mancate azioni positive a favore della pace visto che la situazione in jugoslavia continua a ristagnare
italian i lavori in corso della cig in secondo luogo sono orientati pi verso un europa a due velocit che non verso la democratizzazione come dimostrano sia il continuo riferimento alla cooperazione rafforzata che le varie proposte di ridurre il ruolo dei paesi piccoli in consiglio e commissione
italian in terzo luogo sotto la pressione esercitata in particolare dal regno unito l unione non riuscita ad elaborare un accordo concreto e un calendario vincolante relativamente all informazione fiscale lasciando piena libert ai paradisi fiscali dentro l europa
italian infine il vertice di lisbona a met della presidenza portoghese ha dato il via libera all abbandono del modello previdenziale europeo e al suo adeguamento al modello americano
italian i socialdemocratici danesi del parlamento europeo oggi hanno votato a favore della risoluzione sulle conclusioni del consiglio europeo di feira del giugno
italian lo abbiamo fatto perche apprezziamo il lavoro svolto dalla presidenza che ha elaborato un programma valido e rivolto al futuro dell europa come emerge anche nel capitolo della risoluzione sul seguito del consiglio europeo di lisbona
italian il nostro voto globale non deve essere per interpretato come un sostegno da parte nostra all auspicio di ampliare l ordine del giorno della cig e all inserimento della carta dei diritti fondamentali con effetto giuridico vincolante nel trattato a tale riguardo rinvio alle nostre dichiarazioni di voto espresse per il consiglio europeo di helsinki la convocazione della cig la posizione del parlamento europeo in relazione alla conferenza intergovernativa e la preparazione del consiglio europeo di feira
italian fr mi stato impossibile votare a favore della risoluzione di compromesso soprattutto perche la parte relativa alla tassazione troppo povera e fornisce un giudizio falso su ci che stato effettivamente deciso a feira
italian il parlamento avrebbe fatto meglio a rilevare certo con soddisfazione la determinazione dei capi di stato e di governo di raggiungere un accordo integrale sulla totalit del pacchetto fiscale tassazione dei redditi da risparmio tassazione delle imprese interessi e canoni entro la fine del
italian sarebbe stato necessario confermare la necessit di preservare la competitivit dei mercati finanziari europei adottando contemporaneamente misure equivalenti nei maggiori paesi terzi e misure identiche nei territori dipendenti o associati
italian sarebbe anche stato necessario chiedere di poter esaminare le relazioni che la commissione dovr presentare a intervalli regolari sull applicazione dei sistemi di scambio d informazioni e di ritenuta alla fonte in materia di tassazione del risparmio cos come la relazione sulla base della quale saranno decise l adozione e l applicazione della direttiva
italian vorrei ricordare che ci non avvenuto
italian sono consapevole che i pareri sul compromesso fiscale negoziato con enorme difficolt a feira sono molto eterogenei come emerge dalla stampa europea
italian non posso fare a meno di citare alcuni titoli compromesso dilatorio sulla tassazione del risparmio dubbi sul compromesso fiscale di feira accordo fittizio e divergenze persistenti accordo zoppicante ritenuta alla fonte coesistenza inutili
italian o ancora lo scozzese brown rafforza londra come piazza finanziaria
italian londra si impone nel contenzioso fiscale dell unione le banche svizzere non vedono la necessit di agire prima che sia abolito il segreto bancario tutte le piazze finanziarie devono collaborare
italian anche l osservazione pubblicata sul basler zeitung del giugno scorso la dice lunga a questo proposito e pi probabile che crolli il matterhorn che i cittadini svizzeri votino per l abolizione del segreto bancario e che il ministro delle finanze di berna diventi l esattore fiscale di bruxelles
italian in tale contesto il titolo dell echo del giugno che osserva giustamente che senza garanzie sufficienti lussemburgo bloccher la direttiva sulla tassazione e che lo scambio di informazioni dovr essere attuato anche dalle piazze concorrenti riflette ci che stato effettivamente deciso a feira
italian il fatto che la nostra risoluzione deplori il calendario fissato a feira mostra l ignoranza o l illusione dei suoi autori ai quali vorrei ricordare ci che il primo ministro lussemburghese ha tenuto a precisare in proposito a feira ovvero che in materia di tassazione dei risparmi rimangono ancora una cinquantina di problemi tecnici che il consiglio non ha mai affrontato
italian rimproverare al calendario previsto di non riflettere l urgenza del problema dimostra un assoluta mancanza di realismo e di responsabilit
italian fr un espressione sorprendente comparsa sulle labbra dell ultimo presidente del consiglio quando ci ha presentato luned sera il bilancio della presidenza portoghese
italian il primo ministro antonio guterres ha dichiarato che non bisogna lasciare spazio ad una deriva intergovernativa
italian e necessario che il dibattito sull europa federale che appena stato rilanciato sia portato avanti nella sua interezza
italian non paradossale vedere il rappresentante dei governi degli stati membri denunciare il rischio di deriva intergovernativa dell unione europea
italian il paradosso ancora pi evidente visto che chiaro agli occhi di tutti o quasi l impasse a cui conducono le formule federaliste e in particolare le ultime in ordine di tempo ovvero le cooperazioni rafforzate per cercare di risolvere l insanabile contraddizione tra federalismo e ampliamento durante tutta la presidenza portoghese stata messa in evidenza con particolare vigore la formula miracolosa delle cooperazioni rafforzate
italian lo stesso presidente chirac ne ha parlato in quest aula presentandola come una sorta di soluzione universale con un avanguardia di paesi pionieri pronti ad indicare la strada a tutti gli altri
italian osserviamo inoltre che per quel che concerne l avanguardia nell ambito del federalismo europeo sono ricomparse espressioni che hanno avuto in passato enorme fortuna in altri ambiti ideologici
italian la presentazione di una simile formula in maniera lirico ideologica dissipa i reali pericoli insiti nella generalizzazione del principio della maggioranza qualificata e quindi l eliminazione della regola dell unanimit
italian le cooperazioni rafforzate sono denunciate con forza e a giusto titolo dagli stati membri piccoli e medi come attentatrici della loro dignit visto che la sovranit un principio che garantisce l uguaglianza e il rispetto di ciascuno
italian inoltre nell ambito delle stesse cooperazioni rafforzate l applicazione del principio della maggioranza in luogo dell unanimit rischia di creare tensioni insostenibili conferendo un monopolio di fatto per le decisioni ad un unico paese dominante
italian e quindi evidente che il principio della maggioranza qualificata se inapplicabile con stati non lo nemmeno con o
italian la soluzione miracolosa si rivela in realt una doppia fonte di tensioni che rischiano di ledere profondamente la cooperazione europea
italian per questo motivo proponiamo invece delle cooperazioni rafforzate che sarebbero necessariamente un fattore di pericolose tensioni cooperazioni differenziate concluse fra stati sovrani liberi di concludere gli accordi che vogliono negli ambiti che desiderano purche tali accordi non ledano gli interessi fondamentali dei loro partner
italian tratta di esseri umani
italian fr i deputati di lotta operaia condividono l indignazione espressa nella proposta del gruppo gue che abbiamo votato per la morte dei immigrati a dover e di tanti altri che cercavano di varcare le frontiere esterne o interne dell unione europea
italian per mettere fine ad una situazione in cui la miseria spinge migliaia di essere umani verso luoghi dove sperano di vivere in condizioni migliori bisognerebbe porre fine ad un sistema sociale che per concentrare ricchezze enormi nelle mani di pochi costringe alla povert la maggior parte della popolazione del pianeta
italian non certo un voto del parlamento che porter un cambiamento sebbene sia una necessit vitale per l umanit
italian e scandaloso che le istituzioni attuali nazionali e europee restino indifferenti anche negli ambiti nei quali potrebbero intervenire
italian il dramma di dover si consumato fra due stati europei
italian le barriere erette attorno all unione europea sussistono anche al suo interno per i cittadini di paesi terzi e queste barriere possono uccidere
italian denunciare i farabutti che si arricchiscono con la tratta degli esseri umani non basta occorre assicurare agli immigrati i diritti che dovrebbero essere garantiti a ciascun essere umano
italian occorre assicurare la libera circolazione delle persone porre fine a politiche dell immigrazione che trasformano gli immigrati in una razza inferiore priva di qualsiasi diritto o in clandestini vittime della polizia
italian protestiamo con vigore contro la politica del governo francese che si compiace del suo ruolo di presidente dell unione europea ma che si rifiuta di regolarizzare lavoratori immigrati divenuti clandestini a causa di leggi inique ed esigiamo che siano regolarizzati immediatamente
italian il dramma che si consumato nel porto di dover che ha causato la morte di immigranti e a quello che alcuni mesi fa ha provocato la morte di due bambini della guinea durante l atterraggio di un aereo della sabena sono tragici segnali delle politiche di cooperazione e di sviluppo insufficienti ed errate in vigore e delle politiche di immigrazione e di asilo inadeguate che vengono messe in pratica dall unione europea e dai suoi stati membri
italian questi event che vanno ad aggiungersi all elenco degli effetti nefasti provocati della globalizzazion segnalano l urgenza di adottare orientamenti e mezzi capaci di diminuire il divario che separa i paesi industrializzati da quelli in via di sviluppo nonche la profonda necessit di concretizzare misure legislative nazionali e comunitarie audaci e tolleranti nel settore dell emigrazione destinate soprattutto a migliorare le condizioni di accoglienza degli immigranti per favorirne l integrazione e il pieno riconoscimento dei diritti civili economici sociali e culturali
italian e con questo spirito che abbiamo avanzato una proposta di risoluzione
italian e proprio perche la proposta di compromesso si allontana da questo spirito non intendiamo sottoscriverla anzi la bocciamo in quanto si basa sul presupposto negativo della costruzione di una fortezza europea e vuole giungere a una soluzione dei programmi legati all emigrazione attraverso una via degna di uno stato di polizia
italian signor presidente effettuer la mia dichiarazione di voto per iscritto
italian mi si consenta per una mozione di procedura
italian in passato quando si partecipava alla votazione e si effettuavano dichiarazioni di voto per iscritto si poteva lasciare l aula in quanto la presidenza comunicava di avere ricevuto per le varie relazioni delle dichiarazioni di voto scritte
italian oggi invece occorre attendere ieri ho atteso ben minuti per poter comunicare che avrei effettuato la mia dichiarazione di voto per iscritto
italian e tempo perso considerando che i nostri ritmi sono gi disumani
italian le votazioni infatti si svolgono dalle alle dopodiche occorre rimanere qui fino alle per comunicare che si intende effettuare la dichiarazione di voto per iscritto
italian i servizi mi hanno detto che era necessario rimanere qui
italian forse l avreste accettata tuttavia non potremmo chiarire le cose
italian sono d accordo sul fatto che chi non prende parte alla votazione su una relazione o una risoluzione non possa effettuare una dichiarazione di voto scritta tuttavia perche coloro che hanno preso parte alla votazione e forniscono una dichiarazione scritta devono rimanere qui ancora mezz ora
italian pu spiegarmene il motivo
italian onorevole lulling con chi se la deve prendere
italian con i suoi colleghi che fanno le dichiarazioni di voto
italian se tutti quelli che sono qui le facessero per iscritto lei avrebbe potuto fare la sua un po di tempo prima
italian comunque i suoi colleghi hanno il diritto di fare le dichiarazioni di voto su tutte le relazioni che votiamo
italian signor presidente un commento sui paragrafi e in cui si afferma che la cig rappresenta la questione chiave in vista dell ampliamento
italian non cos
italian la questione chiave piuttosto il modo in cui verranno gestiti i negoziati con i paesi candidati e il risultato a cui porteranno
italian oggi non esiste un termine ultimo e i paesi candidati ritengono che l unione sia del tutto vaga nella sua posizione
italian desidero fare inoltre un commento sul paragrafo il cui contenuto adombra a mio avviso un infelice evoluzione verso la militarizzazione dell unione europea
italian lo dico anche come rappresentante di un paese non allineato
italian in conclusione desidero dedicare due parole al paragrafo in cui si parla di un passo positivo verso il necessario coordinamento fiscale in europa
italian che cosa significa questa affermazione
italian in questo contesto mi preme citare la costituzione svedese che riconosce il consolidato diritto del popolo svedese di decidere delle proprie imposte
italian la seduta sospesa alle riprende alle
italian discussione su problemi d attualita
italian l ordine del giorno reca il dibattito su problemi d attualit urgenti e di notevole rilevanza
italian per un richiamo al regolamento ha la parola l onorevole maaten
italian signora presidente vorrei intervenire all inizio della discussione su problemi di attualit perche ai sensi dell articolo del regolamento penso che sia il momento pi opportuno per farlo
italian l ordine del giorno prevede una risoluzione su euro e gli hooligan
italian sebbene siamo favorevoli a discutere tale problema il testo contiene alcuni elementi che sono tuttora al vaglio delle autorit giudiziarie dei paesi bassi
italian riteniamo quindi che prendere gi una decisione significhi precorrere i risultati del suddetto esame
italian pertanto in conformit dell articolo propongo di rinviare la discussione sulla risoluzione alla tornata di settembre
italian il summenzionato articolo prevede che una richiesta di questo tipo debba essere immediatamente posta in votazione
italian onorevole collega innanzitutto l articolo di cui lei parla fa riferimento esclusivamente ad un gruppo o a deputati
italian tale articolo inoltre non riguarda direttamente la questione delle urgenze il principio stesso delle urgenze prevede che si delibi all inizio della sessione per stabilirne l ambito il che diverso dal rinvio in commissione
italian di conseguenza l urgenza pu essere accettata o rifiutata
italian se accettata dobbiamo andare fino in fondo alla procedura ed necessario tenere il dibattito
italian signora presidente chiediamo che trasmetta alla onorevole fontaine la quale se ne far carico dinanzi alle istituzioni competenti la grande preoccupazione suscitata dalla presenza da oltre due mesi nella baia di algesiras di un sottomarino nucleare del regno unito l hm tireless in avaria che sembra abbia un gravissimo problema nel sistema di raffreddamento
italian secondo le ultime notizie pare che lo vogliano riparare sul posto
italian gli abitanti della zona si oppongono categoricamente con una risoluzione congiunta di tutti i gruppi politici approvata proprio oggi a che la riparazione venga effettuata in loco
italian presentiamo da questa assemblea una richiesta urgente al governo del regno unito affinche rimorchi immediatamente quell affare fuori dalla baia e che lo ripari in inghilterra dove si suppone che perlomeno ci siano installazioni adatte al caso
italian onorevole collega le sue osservazioni saranno comunicate alla onorevole fontaine che sono certa ne terr conto
italian signora presidente ci sono alcuni gruppi che appoggiano la richiesta dell onorevole maaten
italian egli ha parlato a nome del gruppo eldr e io mi associo alla richiesta a nome del gruppo edd
italian pertanto la invito a procedere alla votazione come previsto dal regolamento
italian no onorevole blokland il regolamento non prevede che si possa mettere ai voti il rinvio di un urgenza
italian la questione delle urgenze molto particolare stata messa ai voti luned e l assemblea sovrana ne ha stabilito l ambito
italian dal momento in cui si stabilisce che si tratta di un urgenza non pu esserci un rinvio
italian durante il dibattito si potr tenere conto delle argomentazioni sviluppate da lei e dall onorevole maaten ma non posso mettere ai voti il rinvio di questo dibattito
italian signora presidente lei lo interpreta in un modo ma io ho riletto il testo e non c scritto che sono escluse le discussioni su problemi d attualit
italian su qualsiasi argomento iscritto il luned all ordine del giorno da parte dell assemblea nel corso della settimana pu essere deciso ad un analisi pi attenta condotta sulla scorta di nuovi elementi di toglierlo dall ordine del giorno
italian in questo caso ci sono nuovi argomenti
italian nel frattempo sappiamo che le autorit giudiziarie olandesi stanno compiendo un indagine
italian pertanto mi sembra chiaro che luned quando abbiamo deciso di discutere questo tema non eravamo a conoscenza di tale fatto
italian disponiamo di nuove informazioni e dobbiamo tenerne conto
italian perci ritengo che la sua interpretazione del regolamento non rispetti la lettera del regolamento stesso
italian onorevole blokland mi sembra che la mia interpretazione corrisponda allo spirito e alla lettera del nostro regolamento
italian il regolamento prevede che l ordine del giorn abbiamo infatti a che fare con la stesura dell ordine del giorn sia stabilito dall assemblea all inizio delle sessioni ed ci che stato fatto
italian a prescindere da ci nel caso in cui vi siano elementi nuovi potrete farli presenti nel corso del dibattito e serviranno a chiarire il voto dei nostri colleghi
italian tuttavia io mi attengo a questa interpretazione che tiene conto sia del principio dell ordine del giorno sia di quello delle urgenze
italian signora presidente intervengo solo per unirmi a quanto ha detto il collega del partito andaluso dell andalusia e proporre come luogo per la riparazione del sottomarino britannico i giardini di buckingham palace dove possono portare detto mostro
italian onorevoli colleghi la questione del rinvio ha suscitato queste argomentazioni
italian rimango sulla mia posizione e propongo di passare direttamente al dibattito sulle isole figi e salomone poiche i nostri colleghi lo stanno aspettando
italian isole figi e salomone
italian l ordine del giorno reca in discussione congiunta le seguenti proposte di risoluzione
italian b dell onorevole speroni a nome del gruppo tdi sulle isole figi
italian b della onorevole ludford a nome del gruppo eldr sulla situazione nelle isole figi e nelle isole salomone
italian b degli onorevoli corrie e van hecke a nome del gruppo ppe de sulla situazione nelle isole figi e nelle isole salomone
italian b dell onorevole marset campos a nome del gruppo gue ngl sulla situazione nelle isole figi e nelle isole salomone
italian b dell onorevole lucas a nome del gruppo verys ale sulla situazione nelle isole figi
italian b dell onorevole lucas a nome del gruppo verts ale sulla situazione nelle isole salomone
italian b degli onorevoli van den berg e kinnock a nome del gruppo pse sulle isole figi e le isole salomone
italian signora presidente quello che sta succedendo nelle isole figi dimostra ancora una volta che le patetiche illusioni di chi crede nella societ multietnica e multirazziale in realt non hanno un riscontro
italian vediamo infatti che il conflitto in queste isole tra l etnia originaria e l etnia immigrata esploso in maniera non molto cruenta a dire il vero ma comunque deflagrante
italian lo stesso sta succedendo nelle vicine isole salomone lo stesso sta accadendo in varie parti del mondo basti pensare a quello che successo nella regione dei grandi laghi africani basta pensare a quello che successo all isola di timor basta pensare a quello che sta succedendo nelle molucche dove viene dimostrato che la convivenza tra comunit con tradizioni cultura storia completamente diverse al di l dei buoni propositi di chi auspica la globalizzazione totale anche sotto questo profilo in realt non accade
italian allora bisogna secondo me puntare soprattutto sulla tutela delle etnie indigene per evitare che i figiani originari facciano la fine degli indios sudamericani facciano la fine delle popolazioni originarie del centro e nordamerica e fare in modo che la loro cultura venga preservata attraverso un controllo dell immigrazione selvaggia perche quello che succede l non succeda come purtroppo gi successo nei balcani anche nella nostra europa
italian signora presidente il parlamento rivolge particolare attenzione a quelle regioni in cui le tensioni etniche provocano conflitti e tentativi di rovesciare la democrazia e lo stato di diritto
italian sia nelle isole figi che nelle isole salomone il governo democratico la legge e l ordine sono gravemente minacciati
italian nelle figi il nostro obiettivo dev essere di ripristinare il governo legittimo eletto sulla base della costituzione multirazziale del che stata approvata da entrambi i gruppi etnici i figiani di origine indiana e i figiani indigeni
italian la violenza contro cose e persone deve cessare e gli ostaggi devono essere rilasciati
italian il governo civile provvisorio instaurato nelle figi non rispetta ne i principi costituzionali ne quelli democratici esortiamo quindi la commissione ad avviare con decisione le procedure necessarie a sospendere la cooperazione allo sviluppo con le isole figi
italian gli sfortunati abitanti delle figi guardano all unione europea faro di democrazia ed uguaglianza razziale affinche giunga in loro aiuto
italian vorremmo anche far sapere alle isole salomone che potrebbe essere necessaria una sospensione degli aiuti per ripristinare la democrazia la pace e la stabilit
italian signora presidente intendo dedicare il mio intervento principalmente alle isole salomone ma prima mi permetta di accennare brevemente alle isole figi infatti il vicepresidente della delegazione acp ue di cui faccio parte uno degli ostaggi e vorrei chiedere di scrivere una lettera di solidariet alla sua famiglia
italian la delegazione acp ue si recata alle isole salomone per studiare le tensioni etniche che affliggono quel paese dopo i colloqui avuti stato subito chiaro che un colpo di stato era imminente
italian ma perche si verificato
italian al nostro arrivo abbiamo trovato una situazione di completo vuoto di potere non vi era alcun dialogo tra le fazioni in conflitto e il parlamento non si riuniva
italian nessuno faceva rispettare la legge poiche coloro che di giorno rappresentavano la polizia si trasformavano di notte in militanti malaitani sono stati proprio costoro ad aprire le proprie armerie ai malaitani la mattina del colpo di stato
italian il percento di guadalcanal controllato dal gruppo imf mentre i malaitani occupano soltanto honiara la situazione insostenibile
italian il conflitto etnico scaturisce dall espulsione da guadalcanal di malaitani che sono stati rispediti senza alcun indennizzo nella propria isola dove li attendono gravi difficolt
italian poiche erano gli unici a lavorare adesso a guadalcanal c il blocco totale di ogni attivit sia nelle aree urbane che in quelle rurali
italian
italian
italian l azione svolta dalla onorevole kinnock e da me ha avuto effetti positivi siamo riusciti ad avviare il dialogo siamo riusciti a far ritirare l ultimatum che intimava al primo ministro di dimettersi entro quarantott ore abbiamo suggerito di convocare il parlamento per discutere la situazione e il nostro invito stato accolto
italian inopinatamente il capo dell opposizione divenuto ora primo ministro
italian tutto ci successo perche abbiamo fatto capire che se fosse prevalsa la forza delle armi l unione europea avrebbe potuto ritirare i propri aiuti questi aiuti ammontano al percento del pil del paese
italian vorrei concludere con un ringraziamento ai membri dell ufficio della delegazione per il loro prezioso aiuto
italian signora presidente onorevoli colleghi vero che il pacifico evoca sempre immagini paradisiache spiagge palme da cocco sole
italian oggi la realt molto pi triste infatti i due colpi di stato verificatisi recentemente nelle isole figi rivelano stati instabili divisi dalla povert
italian oltre all indifferenza delle nostre istituzioni la cosa incredibile che la causa di questi conflitti viene sempre ricercata nelle tensioni interetniche
italian sappiamo per che le vere cause non sono solo queste
italian nelle isole salomone la maggioranza della popolazione melanesiana e cristiana nelle isole figi quasi la met della popolazione di origine indiana ma questa origine risale al secolo scorso
italian tuttavia malgrado queste differenze ciascuno a casa propria nelle figi
italian credo che le cause siano altre diverse da questi conflitti interetnici
italian si nega ad esempio il ruolo svolto da coloro che traggono vantaggio dai conflitti ovvero le multinazionali e i politici locali
italian per le prime i periodi di instabilit significano meno obblighi in ambito sociale fiscale ambientale in quanto lo stato diventa molto debole e i conflitti favoriscono l industria delle armi in quanto occorre armare i gruppi politici
italian scagliarsi gli uni contro gli altri una pratica che permette ai politici di creare uno spazio politico o mantenere il potere e ci che fa ad esempio l estrema destra da noi
italian questa pratica possibile solo perche la popolazione povera e non conosce altro
italian nel caso attuale i due conflitti avrebbero dovuto permettere ad alcuni di ricominciare o di ottenere un potere che non riuscivano a raggiungere con le elezioni
italian nelle figi il colpo di stato stato fomentato da un uomo d affari in fallimento che ha approfittato delle sue lontane origini figiane per legittimare la sua azione anche il nuovo primo ministro proviene dal mondo degli affari
italian nelle isole salomone un voto apparente del parlamento ha portato al potere un nuovo primo ministro eletto grazie alle armi
italian questi due esempi rafforzano la nostra idea del conflitto
italian la risoluzione congiunta tuttavia troppo moralizzatrice e chiede di fatto un ritorno alla situazione precedente
italian essa non affronta come troppo spesso accade le vere cause dei conflitti quali la povert e il ruolo latente e interessato di attori economici e politici
italian da questo punto di vista per essere efficienti occorre prevenire i nuovi conflitti incentivando concretamente lo sviluppo dell istruzione dell economia locale e della democrazia locale
italian cos facendo riusciremo forse a far cambiare le cose
italian signora presidente intendo parlare delle isole figi
italian alcuni giorni fa un gruppo di figiani di origine indiana i quali rappresentavano sia quella comunit che la diaspora indiana hanno visitato il nostro parlamento per esporci le loro preoccupazioni in merito a questi conflitti
italian hanno espresso profondi timori per la situazione delle isole figi che riveste un grande valore simbolico e che potrebbe ripercuotersi sulla sorte delle comunit indiane in altre parti del mondo ma la loro angoscia non riguardava solo la comunit etnica indiana bens il destino stesso delle figi
italian dal vige in quel paese una costituzione multirazziale che aveva lo scopo di risolvere i problemi etnici delle isole tra cui soprattutto la questione agraria la costituzione era stata approvata all unanimit da un parlamento dominato dal gruppo etnico figiano e aveva ricevuto pure l approvazione del gran consiglio dei capi
italian per la prospera societ multirazziale di queste isole si trattava di una costituzione modello
italian l illegalit e la violenza hanno indebolito la costituzione ma dobbiamo esaminare in maniera pi approfondita le cause del conflitto
italian il nostro parlamento deve vigilare su ogni manifestazione di violenza e di illegalit che si verifica nei paesi che ricevono i nostri aiuti dobbiamo altres vegliare sulla sorte delle minoranze etniche minacciate
italian i timori che sono stati espressi dai nostri ospiti sono ben concreti
italian abbiamo la facolt di sospendere gli aiuti se giungiamo alla conclusione che la situazione delle isole figi divenuta inaccettabile
italian glenys kinnock ed io insieme agli altri colleghi che hanno incontrato la comunit etnica indiana vogliamo contribuire alla soluzione del conflitto
italian signora presidente onorevoli parlamentari la commissione osserva con crescente preoccupazione quanto avviene nelle isole figi dal maggio
italian e davvero scoraggiante constatare come si mettano a repentaglio le conquiste di un intero secolo
italian c era una costituzione che non si fondava sul razzismo ora stata soppressa
italian esisteva un governo eletto democraticamente stato abbattuto e sostituito da un governo di transizione civile ma nominato dai militari
italian le figi hanno gi subito enormi danni economici
italian le figi rischiano di perdere la fiducia degli investitori
italian guardando alla situazione in un ottica politica le figi che orgogliosamente avevano voluto dare il loro nome al nuovo accordo di ventennale collaborazione tra paesi acp e unione europea rischiano di compromettere le loro relazioni con la comunit internazionale
italian rischiano addirittura di essere escluse dal commonwealth
italian la commissione sta preparando una proposta indirizzata al consiglio sull applicazione dell articolo lettera a della convenzione di lome in quanto ritiene che i principi fondamentali della convenzion ovvero la democrazia lo stato di diritto e la salvaguardia dei diritti dell uom non siano pi garantiti nelle isole figi
italian ricordo comunque che questa decisione prevede una consultazione preliminare delle parti
italian si prenderanno in esame altri provvedimenti o sanzioni solo in una seconda fase in base all esito delle consultazioni e a come questo verr valutato
italian in questo momento dunque prematuro discutere di altre misure o di sanzioni
italian qualsiasi risposta dovr essere attentamente formulata e seguita in modo mirato
italian dovremo evitare effetti come quelli indotti dal divieto di interscambio imposto dai sindacati in australia e nuova zelanda ovvero il licenziamento di oltre lavoratori dell industria dell abbigliamento e del turismo
italian passiamo ora alle isole salomone anche qui la commissione ha constatato con preoccupazione l aggravarsi delle condizioni di sicurezza
italian la commissione sostiene tutti gli sforzi intrapresi dai mediatori per fare in modo che i problemi aperti e le divergenze di opinione vengano risolti tra le parti in questione apertamente e senza la minaccia di ricorrere alla forza
italian la commissione tiene pronti gli strumenti di cui dispone per sostenere il processo di pace non appena la situazione politica e di sicurezza lo consentiranno
italian la discussione congiunta chiusa
italian la votazione si svolger alle
italian tibet
italian l ordine del giorno reca in discussione congiunta le seguenti proposte di risoluzione
italian b presentata dall onorevole pannella e altri a nome del gruppo tdi sulla necessit di fermare la colonizzazione cinese e adottare un nuovo status per il tibet
italian b presentata dalla onorevole sanders ten holte a nome del gruppo eldr sull urgente necessit di negoziati sino tibetani in vista dell adozione di un nuovo status per il tibet
italian b presentata dalla onorevole muscardini e dall onorevole collins a nome del gruppo uen sul tibet
italian b presentata dagli onorevoli thomas mann e bowis a nome del gruppo ppe de sul progetto di riduzione della povert nella cina occidentale e futuro del tibet
italian b presentata dall onorevole messner e dalla onorevole frassoni a nome del gruppo verts ale sull urgente necessit di negoziati sino tibetani in vista dell adozione di un nuovo status per il tibet
italian b presentata dagli onorevoli sakellariou e veltroni a nome del gruppo pse sul tibet
italian signora presidente signor commissario onorevoli colleghi ritengo che il testo sul tibet che ci apprestiamo a votare sia un testo importante e che oggi abbiamo la possibilit di compiere un progresso significativo in questa battaglia fondamentale
italian e una battaglia per la legalit a livello internazionale
italian il tibet invaso nel dalle truppe cinesi da allora occupato e colonizzato dai cinesi
italian penso che dobbiamo certamente votare compatti per questa risoluzione ma anche per l emendamento presentato dall onorevole mann a nome del gruppo liberale e del gruppo verde con tale emendamento si richiede ai nostri governi di considerare la possibilit di riconoscere il governo tibetano in esilio se entro tre anni le autorit cinesi e il governo tibetano in esilio non saranno ancora giunti ad un accordo per una sostanziale autonomia del tibet
italian non possiamo pi lasciare alla sola buona volont e in questo caso alla cattiva volont delle autorit di pechino la pi ampia libert di non affrontare tale problema dobbiamo obbligarle a farlo
italian mediante l azione politica del nostro parlamento dobbiamo affermare la nostra volont di trovare una soluzione a questa situazione che perdura da oltre cinquant anni
italian vorrei rivolgere un appello particolare agli amici di sinistra agli amici socialisti e comunisti non continuate ad adottare due pesi e due misure
italian noi tutti ricordiamo le grandi battaglie per l indipendenza dell africa per la liberazione dell algeria e del vietnam
italian stando a quanto ci dato di constatare oggi questo paese ancora nelle mani di un regime totalitario e dittatoriale
italian in questo momento in tibet in atto una battaglia non violenta per la democrazia
italian non vi alcun motivo per non intervenire ora cos come in tanti avevamo fatto in quegli anni
italian la questione del tibet deve diventare oggi un caso di diritto per l affermazione del principio della non violenza da parte della comunit internazionale
italian certo la cina un grande paese che ha diritto alla democrazia ma questo fatto non pu costituire un pretesto per negare ancora il diritto del popolo tibetano a vivere secondo la propria cultura e in piena autonomia nei vari ambiti che regolamentano la vita di un popolo
italian invito pertanto gli amici socialisti e comunisti a votare a favore della risoluzione e di questo emendamento e a fare in modo che almeno per una volta il nostro parlamento sia in prima linea in questa battaglia per la libert per la democrazia e la non violenza
italian signora presidente auguro buon compleanno al dhalai lama anche se non so se per lui si tratti davvero di un giorno felice perche il pi importante contributo che l unione europea pu fornire al mondo quello di battersi per il rispetto dei diritti dell uomo e della democrazia che nel tibet vengono tuttora calpestati
italian alla luce di tale considerazione desidero evidenziare quanto segue
italian primo com possibile che non vi sia ancora un vero dialogo a livello ufficiale tra governo cinese e governo tibetano in esilio
italian tutti i cosiddetti contatti indiretti non portano a nulla
italian il parlamento europeo deve assumere un atteggiamento pi deciso per sostenere il principio della non violenza ed a questo obiettivo che mira la presente risoluzione
italian secondo com possibile che un istituzione tanto rinomata come la banca mondiale sia sul punto di finanziare un programma cinese che implica la colonizzazione del tibet
italian bisogna impedire che ci accada ed a questo obiettivo che mira la presente risoluzione
italian terzo com possibile che anche l unione europea lasci che nei suoi rapporti con la cina prevalgano gli interessi economici
italian non possibile che rivolgiamo l attenzione al popolo tibetano soltanto quando ci conviene
italian signora presidente in breve la invito a far s che si sviluppi un vero dialogo secondo le linee del piano di pace in cinque punti elaborato dal dhalai lama allora s che sar un giorno felice per tutto il popolo tibetano
italian signor presidente commissario verheugen onorevoli colleghi domani la banca mondiale prender una decisione di importanza fondamentale per il tibet
italian l aiuto internazionale dovrebbe attenuare l indigenza nella parte occidentale della cina e chi non disposto in linea di principio ad aiutare coloro che non sono in grado di aiutare se stessi
italian nell ambito di questo progetto per esseri umani devono essere forzatamente trasferiti in tibet
italian ma con uno spostamento di tale entit i tibetani si ritroverebbero gradualmente ad essere una minoranza nella loro stessa patria e tutto ci dopo che in quel paese gi da decenni la cultura e i luoghi sacri vengono distrutti e la popolazione viene minacciata e perseguitata
italian i membri del nostro tibet intergroup e molti altri parlamentari europei quindici giorni fa si sono rivolti al presidente della banca mondiale a washington affinche non venga meno ai principi riconosciuti dalla stessa banca mondiale di tutela dei popoli minacciati
italian ci siamo rivolti ai parlamenti nazionali ai ministeri delle finanze degli stati europei e degli stati uniti d america e di altri continenti e naturalmente ci siamo rivolti anche al commissario chris patten
italian abbiamo chiesto con urgenza ai membri del board della banca mondiale di eseguire prima di tutto un attenta analisi della relazione degli ispettori indipendenti
italian essi infatti si dicono molto preoccupati questo spostamento di popoli nell ambito di un programma di irrigazione sar giusto dal punto di vista della politica ambientale ed al tempo stesso sar socialmente sostenibile
italian se si devono utilizzare fondi pubblici doveroso che anche le motivazioni del progetto siano rese pubbliche
italian recentemente ho potuto rendermi conto di persona durante una visita a pechino che resa pi forte dalla prevista adesione al wto la cina sempre pi consapevole del suo ruolo di prossima potenza mondiale
italian questo per deve essere contemporaneamente anche un impegno a comportarsi pi responsabilmente di quanto sia avvenuto finora e per esempio a mettere in pratica il concetto one chin many systems
italian la piena autonomia promessa per il tibet deve essere finalmente garantita
italian e nel concetto di autonomia rientrano la libert di religione la libert d opinione e la libert di vivere le proprie scelte culturali e sociali
italian si devono avviare colloqui bilaterali con i responsabili autorizzati il dhalai lama sempre disponibile
italian come ha ricordato la mia collega oggi il dhalai lama premio nobel per la pace e personalit universalmente accettata festeggia i suoi anni ed il cinquantesimo anniversario come capo spirituale dei tibetani
italian resta sempre valido il suo piano di pace articolato in cinque punti che testimonia della sua scelta profondamente non violenta
italian sarebbe davvero il momento di avviare dialoghi costruttivi su queste basi
italian a nome del gruppo del ppe e del tibet intergroup mi appello a tutti i membri del parlamento europeo affinche sostengano la nostra risoluzione
italian solo una protesta di dimensioni mondiali poco prima della decisione della banca mondiale prevista domani pu impedire che la situazione volga al peggio con gravi conseguenze
italian tashi delek
italian signora presidente signor commissario onorevoli colleghi siamo sul punto di votare per la tredicesima volta una risoluzione sul tibet e se analizziamo i risultati fin qui ottenuti dobbiamo constatare che sono oltremodo scarsi
italian pertanto mi rivolgo al signor commissario vorrei che l unione europea con le sue tre forti istituzioni si indirizzasse all opinione pubblica mondiale alle autorit cinesi e alla banca mondiale in particolare
italian i colleghi lo hanno gi detto dobbiamo porre fine alla colonizzazione interna al massacro dell identit culturale del popolo tibetano
italian ci sar possibile soltanto se la banca mondiale cesser di finanziare proprio il contrario di tutto questo ossia l importazione dei cinesi in tibet allo scopo di annientare la cultura originale
italian non possiamo destinare il denaro dei contribuenti a un simile obiettivo
italian mi auguro che lei collabori con noi per imprimere una svolta come richiesto negli emendamenti presentati dai colleghi una svolta per cui se entro tre anni non si sar verificato alcun mutamento riconosceremo il governo provvisorio del tibet invece che continuare a vivere in una situazione di stallo
italian queste trattative dovrebbero essere fondat come gi stato ricordat sui cinque punti del programma del dhalai lama che appoggiamo in tutti i modi e al quale facciamo anche gli auguri per il suo compleanno
italian signora presidente negli ultimi anni abbiamo celebrato il cinquantenario della fine della seconda guerra mondiale poi quello della fondazione delle nazioni unite e dell organizzazione mondiale della sanit e ancora il ritorno all indipendenza degli stati baltici dopo cinquant anni di dominazione sovietica purtroppo per dobbiamo commemorare anche il cinquantenario dell illegittima occupazione del tibet da parte della cina cinquanta anni in cui il popolo tibetano ha sofferto l oppressione e la repressione del regime cinese
italian non dobbiamo permettere che tale situazione diventi un fatto compiuto da ci scaturisce l emendamento apportato a questa risoluzione per esercitare pressioni sulla cina emendamento che sostengo vigorosamente
italian da ci scaturisce anche la risoluzione generale che chiede alla banca mondiale di ritirare il proprio appoggio al nostro cosiddetto progetto che significherebbe non solo il trasferimento di circa cinesi in una zona attualmente popolata da tibetani dediti alla pastorizia ma anche lo sfruttamento delle risorse naturali del tibet
italian entrambe queste iniziative sono immorali entrambe contrastano con il diritto internazionale a entrambe devono reagire il nostro parlamento e l unione europea levandosi in difesa del tibet e del suo popolo
italian signor presidente devo iniziare dicendo che intervengo ora a nome della sinistra verde nordica
italian noi riteniamo che i tibetani debbano vedersi riconosciuta l autonomia cui essi stessi ambiscono
italian siamo inoltre preoccupati per l indisponibilit al dialogo manifestata dalla cina
italian mi rivolgo ora al commissario spero che la commissione abbia degli ottimi contatti con i rappresentanti della banca mondiale
italian la decisione infatti va presa gi domani
italian abbiamo quindi pochissimo tempo per cercare di intervenire presso la banca mondiale alla quale questa risoluzione dopo tutto si rivolge in via prioritaria
italian e solitamente difficile influire sulla banca mondiale
italian desidero pertanto sapere se sia possibile contattare questa istituzione oppure se non sia meglio utilizzare le ore notturne per tentare di contattare i nostri esponenti di governo
italian peraltro non mi pare che ora il consiglio sia molto rappresentato
italian signora presidente ho avuto modo di verificare personalmente la situazione in tibet una situazione ben pi grave umiliante e penosa di quello che si pu esprimere in quest aula cos come in qualsiasi altro convegno
italian i cinesi in questi ultimi quarant anni hanno negato veramente con la forza la libert ai tibetani hanno annullato l identit di questo popolo e ancora di pi hanno calpestato i diritti umani e soprattutto la dignit delle persone
italian ecco perche necessario che un parlamento cos sensibile ai diritti dell uomo e alla lotta alla xenofobia e al razzismo pretenda dalla cina la negoziazione di un nuovo statuto proprio per il pieno riconoscimento dei diritti dei tibetani uno statuto che garantisca veramente la piena autonomia a questo popolo
italian voglio per essere chiara fino in fondo anche a rischio forse di sembrare polemica
italian bisogna fare attenzione alle ipocrisie infatti inutile sottoscrivere come oggi stiamo facendo una risoluzione comune piena di buoni principi belle parole e anche piena di sdegno e poi lasciare che le massime autorit cinesi magari per motivi economici e commerciali vengano accolte con i massimi onori dai nostri ministri o dai sindaci delle varie capitali europee come avverr per esempio proprio domani a roma dove rutelli che sindaco di roma nonche eurodeputato ricever ufficialmente il primo ministro cinese o comunque una delegazione
italian credo che se continueremo a sacrificare i principi e i diritti in nome dell economia sar ben difficile al di l delle dichiarazioni di principio che si possono fare nelle aule parlamentari arrivare a un autentica soluzione per il popolo tibetano
italian signora presidente come il parlamento anche la commissione nutre profonda preoccupazione per la situazione dei diritti umani in tibet
italian in particolare siamo in ansia per il rispetto dell identit culturale linguistica e religiosa della regione autonoma del tibet da parte delle autorit cinesi
italian abbiamo affrontato ripetutamente questo tema nell ambito del dialogo bilaterale con la cina sul tema dei diritti dell uomo
italian pi esattamente l unione europea ha esortato la cina a riprendere quanto prima le relazioni con il dhalai lama
italian riteniamo infatti che un dialogo diretto fra dhalai lama e autorit cinesi sia l unica strada realistica che possa portare a una soluzione pacifica e duratura della questione tibetana
italian per quanto riguarda poi la cooperazione l unione europea ritiene che il sostegno di progetti di aiuto sia nell interesse della popolazione del tibet purche il gruppo etnico tibetano tragga diretto profitto da questi progetti ed abbia la priorit nella gestione degli stessi
italian in passato si verificato proprio questo con la relativa assicurazione ufficiale delle autorit cinesi
italian per quanto riguarda il progetto della banca mondiale posso solo comunicarvi che la commissione non vi partecipa
italian non ritengo pertanto che arrivati ormai all ultimo momento noi possiamo influenzare molto la situazione
italian se c ancora qualche possibilit d influenza solo da parte degli stati membri
italian diritti dell uomo
italian signora presidente signor commissario si pu dire molto su questa vicenda
italian in primo luogo spero soprattutto che il consiglio e la commissione si attivino affinche questo tema sia affrontato in seno al consiglio di sicurezza che a fine mese discuter del piano d azione relativo ai bambini nei conflitti armati
italian in secondo luogo oggi abbiamo potuto notare con soddisfazione che si tenta di giungere a una soluzione comune almeno per quanto attiene all ennesimo conflitto in cui sono coinvolti bambini soldato mi riferisco alla cosiddetta risoluzione sui diamanti all esame del consiglio di sicurezza
italian in terzo luogo possiamo constatare di avere compiuto alcuni progressi generici per quanto riguarda il problema dei bambini soldato
italian esiste infatti il protocollo aggiuntivo volontario contro il fenomeno dei bambini soldato e poi ci sono ancora le attivit in corso in africa
italian chiedo all aula di appoggiare la risoluzione
italian mi auguro inoltre che anche l unione europea affronti congiuntamente questo problema in seno al consiglio di sicurezza a fine mese in occasione del seguito dato alla discussione generale sui bambini nei conflitti armati
italian signora presidente in particolare la situazione nella regione dell uganda settentrionale e del sudan meridionale d in qualche modo l immagine del dramma dei bambini soldato
italian questo intervento ha il senso come la risoluzione che stata presentata di spingere il parlamento e le istituzioni europee ad iniziative pi stabili che vadano al di l del momento dell urgenza
italian il conflitto armato in questa regione una costante di questi ultimi trent anni la societ civile stata completamente devastata e per pi di dodici anni vari gruppi di ribelli hanno compiuto stragi tra le popolazioni dell uganda settentrionale
italian le loro vittime preferite sono stati i bambini e gli adolescenti perch pi vulnerabili e influenzabili
italian ad oggi circa il percento dei soldati della lord s resistance army sono bambini al di sotto dei sedici anni
italian la strategia appunto quella di manipolarli e di costringerli con brutalit cosicche a loro volta possano uccidere e torturare altri
italian le ragazze adolescenti vengono date ai ribelli come mogli ma quello che soprattutto va rimarcato che l atteggiamento dell lra non affatto mutato neanche dopo gli accordi di nairobi tra uganda e sudan dello scorso dicembre
italian ho avuto occasione nei giorni scorsi di parlare con una delle ragazze che scappata dai campi del sudan meridionale e che ha confermato che l lra non ha alcuna intenzione di mutare la propria posizione
italian questo dimostrato anche dal fatto che oggi si sono celebrati in uganda i funerali di john baptista ochaia che il rappresentante del presidente del distretto di kitgum morto giusto l altro ieri a seguito di ferite riportate in un imboscata dell lra
italian e inaccettabile pertanto che vi sia un atteggiamento da parte delle autorit europee e da parte di molti enti commerciali europei quasi di complicit con questa situazione senza voler in qualche modo rompere il cerchio che sta rubando il destino di una generazione
italian signora presidente onorevoli colleghi le guerre sono sempre orribili e le guerre civili sono ancora pi spaventose
italian ma servirsi di bambini per combattere per uccidere o farsi uccidere oltrepassa ogni limite di barbarie e di orrore
italian la lord s resistance army l organizzazione della resistenza armata non esita a rapire bambini di sette anni a sottoporli a inaudite brutalit per insegnare loro a battersi e a seminare il terrore tra gli abitanti dei villaggi cos come non esita a violentare donne e ragazze
italian bisogna sapere che questi fanciulli se sopravvivono sono segnati per il resto della loro vita
italian occorrono tempo pazienza e amore per ridare loro un po di speranza
italian per questo motivo necessario accrescere l aiuto e il sostegno all unicef che ha predisposto un programma d azione per permettere ai bambini di condurre nuovamente una vita normale
italian signora presidente dobbiamo smetterla di tergiversare il sudan non deve pi sostenere l lra
italian e una forma di complicit che rende quel paese altrettanto colpevole
italian il parlamento deve fare pressione sul governo ugandese affinche trovi una soluzione pacifica al conflitto che ha luogo nel nord del paese e che in quindici anni ha fatt tengo a ricordarl centomila morti
italian tutta la popolazione lo attende e tutti i bambini lo sperano
italian il consiglio di sicurezza deve ascoltare questo appello
italian signora presidente sono davvero lieta che questa risoluzione sia stata presentata
italian spero che la commissione e gli stati membri vengano cos incitati ad agire davvero in questo campo
italian qualche settimana fa la televisione svedese ha trasmesso un documentario sul sudan in cui si spiegava che gli investitori e le compagnie petrolifere estere fra cui una del mio paese la svezia ricevono protezione da truppe che impiegano bambini soldato
italian queste denunce sono corroborate da amnesty international che ha chiarito come alcuni introiti petroliferi siano impiegati per finanziare la guerra civile in corso nel sudan meridionale
italian in quel conflitto sono impiegati bambini soldato ugandesi costretti a partecipare a scontri armati
italian occorre fare pressioni sulle compagnie petrolifere e sugli investitori internazionali
italian e occorre come chiede il paragrafo della risoluzione esortare con determinazione queste societ a cessare le loro attivit nel sudan sino a quando non sar raggiunta una soluzione pacifica al conflitto
italian signora presidente innanzitutto desidero esprimere la mia riconoscenza al collega van hecke e a sua moglie els de temmerman per l impegno profuso al fine di pubblicare a livello europeo tutto ci che si sa sulla questione dei bambini soldato nell uganda settentrionale
italian ci che evidente che non si riusciti ad attuare in misura sufficiente l accordo di nairobi del
italian cos passiamo al problema dell influenza dell unione europea e della nostra disponibilit ad agire assieme in quanto stati membri compiendo un passo comune
italian vorrei sapere dal commissario verheugen se condivide il punto sottolineato con grande chiarezza nella presente risoluzione ossia il blocco immediato degli investimenti relativi al petrolio e agli oleodotti in sudan
italian se esercitiamo pressioni a favore della pacificazione e assicuriamo il controllo nella regione settentrionale del paese possiamo dare concreto avvio ad una politica estera che coniughi sia la parte concernente gli aiuti sia la parte estera sia la parte commerciale
italian e auspicabile con la massima urgenza un azione di questo tipo
italian in questo momento assistiamo ad un aumento delle cifre e degli esempi e nel contempo rileviamo che stiamo esercitando troppo poco potere mentre in quell area disponiamo in effetti di pi potere di quello che abbiamo finora utilizzato
italian passo cos al punto pi ampio relativo alle nazioni unite
italian in maggio l assemblea generale ha approvato il protocollo
italian in luglio si aprir il dibattito nel consiglio di sicurezza
italian questo potrebbe rappresentare un ottima occasione per dimostrare che l europa non si limita a professare le proprie idee al proprio interno ma lo fa anche all esterno inoltre in tale sede lanciamo congiuntamente in quanto stati membri un appello accorato a favore dei diciott anni di una rapida firma e di un azione coordinata ed efficace da parte dei diversi paesi per quanto riguarda l istruzione e il reinserimento nel mondo del lavoro dei bambini soldato
italian a tale riguardo possiamo vantare un buono stato di servizio
italian sarebbe bello se potessimo intervenire con un unico volto ed un unica voce
italian vorrei sapere dal commissario verheugen se ritiene che in luglio vi siano buone opportunit di successo
italian signora presidente ero in uganda nel gennaio scorso quando sono state liberate alcune delle ragazzine che erano state rapite e costrette ad arruolarsi nell lra
italian molte di loro hanno perso ogni contatto con le proprie famiglie e non fanno ritorno a casa da molti anni in seguito agli stupri subiti sono diventate madri a loro volta e ci le emargina ulteriormente dalle comunit dalla quale sono state brutalmente strappate
italian potremo continuare in eterno ad emettere risoluzioni eleganti ed elaborate ma finche la comunit europea non riuscir ad affrontare efficacemente i problemi dei nostri bambini non potremo levare la nostra voce su questo tema
italian molte delle nostre politiche riguardano i diritti e gli interessi dei bambini eppure questa settimana il presidente prodi ha dichiarato di non ritenere necessaria un unit speciale dedicata ai diritti dei bambini nell ambito della comunit
italian questo indebolir la nostra posizione in occasione del vertice speciale dell onu sui bambini che si terr l anno prossimo e nel corso del quale si dedicher particolare attenzione al problema dei bambini soldato
italian situazione nelle isole molucche
italian signora presidente quest oggi le molucche richiamano nuovamente la nostra attenzione
italian dopo un periodo relativamente tranquillo il recente arrivo di alcune migliaia di combattenti della jihad che mirano ad islamizzare le molucche ha portato ad una nuova escalation di violenze
italian la pluriennale coesistenza pacifica di musulmani e cristiani sembra definitivamente cessata
italian non intendo passare sotto silenzio il coraggioso atteggiamento del presidente wahid
italian la scorsa settimana egli ha persino osato criticare la posizione di alcuni deputati
italian se dipendesse dal presidente indonesiano potremmo sperare in un futuro pacifico nelle molucche
italian le forze oscure tuttora presenti nell apparato amministrativ esercito polizia e autorit provocano per una considerevole destabilizzazione della situazione
italian occorrono ancora molti sforzi per eliminare gli elementi fondamentalisti da tutti i raggruppamenti religiosi
italian desidero sottoporre al governo indonesiano alcune raccomandazioni concrete
italian innanzitutto bisogna opporsi con la massima decisione mediante severi controlli di frontiera all arrivo di combattenti e di armi
italian inoltre va ripresa in considerazione l opportunit di inviare truppe d intervento internazionali
italian sembra che i profondi contrasti all interno di esercito e polizia impediscano di giungere ad una conclusione autonoma dei conflitti in indonesia
italian infine vorrei richiamare l attenzione sulle vittime di questi conflitti i comuni cittadini
italian non dobbiamo occuparci soltanto di individuare i colpevoli del conflitto bens anche e soprattutto di fornire aiuti adeguati ai cittadini in fuga
italian e indispensabile creare un corridoio umanitario
italian sosteniamo con decisione l appello lanciato alla commissione e agli stati membri affinche prestino aiuti generosi
italian la mancanza di interessi politici ed economici in quella regione non deve ridurre l entit dei nostri aiuti si tratta di lenire gravi sofferenze che nelle molucche non mancano di certo
italian signora presidente la storia in indonesia si ripete
italian i sanguinosi contrasti tra musulmani e cristiani mettono in pericolo la sicurezza nelle molucche
italian migliaia di persone sono state uccise o sono fuggite e anche il recente e fragile processo di democratizzazione avviato con tante ambizioni dal governo di wahid a rischio
italian soltanto pochi mesi fa la stessa situazione si presentava a timor est
italian in qualit di eurodeputato ho avuto modo di rilevare in loco durante una visita compiuta assieme alla delegazione di osservatori quanto possano essere terribili le conseguenze di tutto ci dobbiamo renderci conto che la violenza nelle molucche comporta un pericolo per la stabilit della regione
italian pertanto importante che la comunit internazionale offra immediatamente aiuti finanziari e morali per contribuire a risolvere i problemi in indonesia
italian la comunit internazionale ha inoltre il dovere di seguire costantemente e con la massima attenzione la situazione locale e di aiutare per quanto possibile il governo a porre fine a questa tragedia umana
italian signora presidente in qualit di relatrice della commissione per gli affari esteri sull indonesia ho esitato al momento di presentare la risoluzione perche quest autunno avremo certamente un importante discussione sui rapporti tra unione europea ed indonesia
italian la situazione nelle molucche per cos grave che davvero necessario trattare con urgenza questo argomento
italian in quell area dopo alcuni mesi di tranquillit si assistito nelle ultime settimane ad una recrudescenza delle violenze di nuovo sono state uccise decine di persone di nuovo migliaia di persone si sono date alla fuga
italian il dramma dell imbarcazione stracolma di profughi provenienti da duma sull isola di halmahera probabilmente costato la vita a cinquecento persone
italian ieri due quartieri di ambon sono stati rasi al suolo da incendi appiccati da combattenti della jihad
italian nell area si sono finora registrati pi di tremila morti e centomila profughi
italian e una catastrofe e molte famiglie molucchesi che risiedono nei paesi bassi vivono in uno stato di profonda preoccupazione o dolore
italian signora presidente malgrado questa tragedia ritengo che dobbiamo dare il nostro supporto al presidente wahid e alla vicepresidente sukarnoputri
italian a quanto sembra non sono loro bens le forze che si oppongono al governo ad aver causato l attuale situazione nelle molucche
italian a quanto pare le milizie della jihad vengono finanziate e armate da questi gruppi e talvolta vengono anche sostenute da forze militari regionali che in realt dovrebbero proteggere la popolazione
italian riteniamo che il governo indonesiano debba intervenire con maggiore decisione al fine di tutelare gli abitanti delle molucche
italian a nostro giudizio inoltre per poter assistere i cittadini molucchesi dev essere assicurato l accesso all area agli osservatori internazionali ai giornalisti e a coloro che forniscono gli aiuti
italian soprattutto riteniamo che l unione europea debba assumere un atteggiamento chiaro cos come gli stati uniti e che l unione europea debba fornire aiuto alle vittime di questi conflitti
italian signora presidente i nostri colleghi del gruppo verde alleanza libera europea hanno presentato una serie di emendamenti che forse sono animati da buone intenzioni ma che a mio parere sono controproducenti in quanto potrebbero fare il gioco delle forze che si oppongono al governo in carica e che contribuiscono a fomentare le provocazioni in atto nelle molucche
italian pertanto respingo l emendamento all articolo a e invito i colleghi degli altri gruppi a seguire il mio esempio
italian l aspetto pi importante per rappresentato da un intervento pi attivo da parte dell unione europea
italian la risoluzione lancia un appello in tal senso e auspico che la commissione risponda in maniera positiva a questo invito
italian signora presidente onorevoli colleghi sempre pi evidente che la violenza nelle molucche non provocata da un conflitto caotico e spontaneo sorto tra la popolazione locale tra musulmani e cristiani locali bens una brutale lotta per il potere e un conflitto ben orchestrato tra parti dell esercito tra il governo e i suoi oppositori a scapito della popolazione del luogo
italian
italian da un lato c la laskar jihad un gruppo di musulmani fanatici che conta sul sostegno di parte dell esercito dall altro reparti speciali della polizia che appoggiano i cristiani in altre parole l apparato di sicurezza che dovrebbe garantire la stabilit diviso tra le due fazioni
italian il messaggio che a mio giudizio il parlamento europeo dovrebbe inviare al presidente wahi e in tal senso spero di poter tranquillizzare la onorevole maij wegge che da un canto manteniamo un atteggiamento critico per quanto concerne i progressi e la velocit a cui vengono attuate le riforme nonche in merito alla situazione relativa ai diritti dell uomo e alla maniera in cui il governo protegge i cittadini nelle molucche dall altro lo appoggiamo nella sua lotta contro quelle parti dell esercito che cercano di mettere a repentaglio le riforme democratiche nella sua lotta contro personaggi quali amien rais il presidente del congresso del popolo che ad esempio ha definito i giovani aderenti alla laskar jihad cuore della nazione
italian in tal senso wahid merita il nostro appoggio ma voglio che conserviamo un atteggiamento critico per quanto riguarda quello che ancora non va in indonesia
italian signora presidente a nome del gruppo pse appoggio quanto affermato dalla onorevole maij weggen
italian in questo momento essenziale dare il nostro sostegno al governo wahid
italian tale sostegno significa anch penso che si tratti di una posizione ragionevole della commissione e del consigli ricercare esplicitamente mezzi per supportare il governo nel suo tentativo di pacificazione e intervenire in maniera attiva ed anche noi lanciamo un appello in questo senso
italian anche noi conserviamo un atteggiamento assai critico nei riguardi di quanto avviene in quell area e siamo molto preoccupati anche per la comunit molucchese che vive nei paesi bassi per i sentimenti e l ansia che prova
italian chiediamo che a wahid sia dato l appoggio di cui ha bisogno perche nel momento in cui si offrono osservatori internazionali o altro al di fuori del controllo del presidente si interviene e si mina il suo potere
italian in tal senso sono nettamente favorevole alla posizione del gruppo ppe e lancio un appello all assemblea affinche venga adottato un approccio in conformit del quale esprimiamo profonda preoccupazione grande disponibilit a dare il nostro sostegno ma attraverso wahid avanzando s delle richieste ma attraverso il presidente perche lui la carta che dobbiamo giocare in questo momento
italian signora presidente la nostra collega onorevole maij weggen ha ragione a definire la situazione catastrofica
italian si tratta infatti di una situazione complicata con molti morti che merita la seguente riflessione perche comunit che convivevano in modo relativamente pacifico hanno subito quest improvvisa evoluzione sfociata in un tale livello di tensione e di minacce
italian ritengo che dietro queste azioni si stiano muovendo alcune forze e la somiglianza che si nota fra quello che accade oggi nelle molucche e quello che succedeva ieri a timor est molto significativa
italian in effetti dietro questi movimenti ci sono delle forze che vogliono sabotare gli sforzi di democratizzazione del presidente wahid forze che dobbiamo capire e combattere
italian da questo punto di vista credo che siano molto opportuni i riferimenti inseriti nella risoluzione di compromesso che stata presentata e che merita tutto il nostro appoggio
italian pena di morte negli stati uniti
italian signora presidente nella risoluzione sulla pena di morte che abbiamo concordato con gli altri gruppi abbiamo chiesto al governatore della virginia di risparmiare la vita di un condannato a morte
italian nell elenco dei destinatari a cui va la nostra risoluzione stato omesso per errore il nome del governatore della virginia la prego se vorr disporre nel testo della nostra risoluzione alla fine di aggiungere il nome del governatore della virginia cui va appunto la nostra petizione
italian certo onorevole collega ha perfettamente ragione
italian nel testo della risoluzione si fa riferimento a questo stato
italian e necessario dal punto di vista tecnico che la risoluzione sia inviata al governatore della virginia ed essa sar votata con questa modifica
italian signora presidente noi possiamo sottoscrivere tutto quanto figura nella risoluzione
italian sappiamo che la commissione per i diritti umani delle nazioni unite ha decretato nell aprile dello scorso anno una moratoria
italian quest anno tale richiesta stata ribadita
italian e stato inoltre chiesto a tutti gli stati in cui ancora vige la pena di morte di ridurre progressivamente il numero di reati per i quali viene comminata la pena capitale
italian disponiamo di dati davvero inquietanti per quanto concerne il numero di persone ancora in attesa di esecuzione negli stati uniti
italian stando alle informazioni in mio possesso si tratterebbe di persone
italian nella risoluzione noi poniamo l accento sull incertezza del diritto che aleggia intorno ai casi in esame
italian vi pertanto motivo di esigere che ogni caso sia oggetto di un indagine ossia che vengano passati in rassegna i casi di tutte le persone in attesa di esecuzione per verificare per esempio se abbiano ottenuto un processo equo
italian ecco perche occorre una moratoria su tutti i casi anche su quelli non menzionati nella risoluzione
italian possiamo inoltre constatare con fiducia che la questione della pena di morte negli stati uniti ha ottenuto un peso politico completamente inedito
italian valuto positivamente anche il lavoro svolto dalle organizzazioni per i diritti umani per dare risalto a questo problema
italian signor presidente signor commissario onorevoli colleghi come ha detto la onorevole thors la nostra assemblea sostiene unanimemente questa risoluzione
italian dobbiamo porci alcune domande a proposito dell azione dell unione europea e della sua capacit di portare avanti a livello delle nazioni unite e della comunit internazionale tale iniziativa a favore di una moratoria internazionale
italian conosciamo le difficolt che le nostre istituzioni incontrano essenzialmente a causa del loro carattere molto complesso soprattutto in politica estera per la quale sono responsabili un commissario un alto rappresentante e quindici ministri degli affari esteri
italian per evitare che si riproponga lo scacco dello scorso anno alle nazioni unite urgente coordinare l azione dell unione europea
italian ho presentato quindi un emendamento per chiedere che questa politica per l istituzione di una moratoria universale sia coordinata a livello delle nazioni unite dall alto rappresentante per la politica estera e la sicurezza comune
italian invito i colleghi a sostenere gli emendamenti che vanno in tal senso
italian signor presidente colleghi stiamo chiedendo in questa sede al governatore della virginia di risparmiare la vita di un condannato a morte probabilmente innocente derek rocco barnabei
italian mentre discutiamo di questa nostra risoluzione in una cella della morte dello stesso stato stanno sterilizzando gli aghi per l iniezione letale con cui verr ucciso tra qualche ora michael clagget probabilmente colpevole di omicidi plurimi perpetrati anni fa
italian non so pi quante risoluzioni abbiamo approvato nelle ultime due legislature nel vano tentativo di por fine negli stati uniti e altrove alla pena di morte certo che molte altre esecuzioni a ritmi sempre pi sostenuti verranno poste in atto entro agosto in virginia e in altri stati primo tra tutti il texas il cui governator quasi certamente il futuro presidente degli stati uniti d americ detiene un primato assoluto quello di avere messo a morte esseri umani negli ultimi cinque anni
italian non so se george w bush meni gran vanto di questo primato ma s perche me l ha scritto lui stesso in una lettera del marz che egli certo di assolvere serenamente ai supremi compiti di una giustizia equa e senza errori
italian nella risoluzione all esame di questo parlamento abbiamo preso atto del nuovo dibattito in corso negli stati uniti non certo sull abolizione della pena capitale ma su una moratoria che porti ad una sua gestione pi certa ma non meno spietata
italian forse abbiamo fatto bene ma temo che tutti questi nostri tentativ come del resto l ha scritto recentemente il quotidiano statunitense herald tribun siano destinati a rimanere flatus vocis lettera morta e allora cari colleghi forse giunto il momento non certo di boicottaggi e sanzioni che aborriamo ma ad esempio di promuovere il turismo europeo solo in quella dozzina di stati d america che non praticano la pena di morte
italian il rischio di ritorsioni grave gravissimo se rinunzieremo a donald duck e a disneyworld in florida avremo il boicottaggio americano della gioconda al louvre
italian e un rischio che ormai va corso in un ultimo tentativo di porre fine ad un istituto cos barbarico cos infamante per la famiglia dell uomo
italian signor presidente gli stati uniti sono lo ricordiamo il paese che da pi tempo dispone di una dichiarazione dei diritti consolidata e applicabile in sede giudiziaria
italian e perci una terribile ironia che gli stati uniti siano uno dei pochi paesi del mondo sviluppato a mantenere e soprattutto a praticare la pena di morte
italian oggi abbiamo davanti a noi il caso di derek rocco barnabei ogni essere umano gode di inalienabili diritti personali e per questo va difeso
italian chiediamo che a barnabei venga risparmiata la vita egli anche un simbolo di una prassi a nostro avviso abominevole che come sappiamo adottata in diverse parti degli stati uniti
italian personalmente amo molto gli stati uniti e vari aspetti del loro stile di vita ho visitato spesso la facolt di giurisprudenza dell universit del texas ed altre facolt di legge negli stati uniti
italian li ammiro moltissimo ma per me un dolore constatare con quale frequenza il texas applichi la pena di morte e ascoltare il governatore di questo stato che se ne vanta nel corso della campagna presidenziale
italian signor presidente l urgenza della nostra risoluzione motivata dal caso di derek rocco bernabei
italian in questo caso specifico ci sono fondati dubbi anche nell opinione pubblica americana che ci sia stato un errore giudiziario
italian e ovvio che quando si tratta di pena di morte l errore giudiziario particolarmente grave non si dimentichi che errori giudiziari in casi analoghi sono stati riconosciuti e non per caso si trattava di persone che non avevano potuto permettersi degli avvocati costosi
italian credo che anche le facolt di diritto degli stati uniti funzionino bene perche gli avvocati sono molto ben pagati ma ben pagati da coloro che hanno i soldi per permetterseli
italian dunque chiediamo la sospensione di questa sentenza chiediamo che la presidenza del parlament tenuto conto anche del documento firmato da numerosissimi colleghi in questi giorn scriva direttamente alle autorit competenti per richiamare in modo particolarmente pressante l attenzione su questo tema e poi naturalmente che si abolisca la pena di morte negli stati uniti verso i quali la nostra ammirazione per tanti aspetti molto pronunciata proprio per questo tanto pi scandaloso vederli mantenere questo rituale barbarico
italian hooligan
italian signor presidente il calcio una festa
italian all insegna di questo slogan belgio e paesi bassi hanno organizzato nelle scorse tre settimane euro
italian sul piano sportivo stata anche una festa tranne forse che per i nostri amici italiani una festa che per stata ancora una volta turbata dal comportamento di alcuni supposti tifosi
italian ci sono stati violenti scontri soprattutto prima e dopo la partita germania inghilterra
italian complessivamente persone sono finite all ospedale sono state fermate e sostenitori inglesi sono stati rimpatriati a bordo di c
italian alcuni fra cui anche degli europarlamentari cercano di minimizzare l accaduto
italian signor presidente a mio giudizio ci sono per dei limiti per quanto riguarda gli elevati costi sociali legati al fenomeno degli hooligan
italian non possibile che un paese assuma per dei giorni l aspetto di uno stato di polizia a causa di un campionato di calcio
italian in belgio sono stati impiegati in media gendarmi per partita con l aggiunta di centinaia di poliziotti locali
italian e ora che i governi nazionali adottino misure preventive per far stare a casa lo zoccolo duro degli hooligan
italian la germania ha dato al riguardo il buon esempio
italian concretamente bisogna imporre un divieto di viaggio e di espatrio ai cosiddetti tifosi che siano gi stati arrestati in passato in quanto coinvolti nella violenza negli stadi
italian pertanto non si tratta in primo luogo di una questione di maggiori o minori controlli alle frontiere ma di una cooperazione valida e coerente tra le forze di polizia
italian dobbiamo trarre le debite conclusioni da quanto accaduto a bruxelles e charleroi
italian per arginare questa assurda violenza sono necessari pi che mai severi provvedimenti e una stretta collaborazione
italian il fenomeno degli hooligan ha superato ogni limite in senso sia letterale che figurato
italian signor presidente troppe tragedie negli stadi e fuori di essi fenomeni che sono segnali di un disequilibrio e di un disagio sociale individuale di una cultura della forza dove la ragione si perde e prevale la violenza
italian la risoluzione del parlamento ribadisce le proprie preoccupazioni per l ampliamento del fenomeno degli hooligans e chiede misure di prevenzione alle quali mi associo
italian ma proprio in questa situazione indispensabile che le forze dell ordine nel loro difficile compito non perdano anch esse la ragione
italian vorrei esprimere qui la mia protesta per i comportamenti delle forze dell ordine olandesi nei confronti di una troupe di giornalisti italiani che riprendevano le sofferenze di un gruppo di disabili portati a braccia sugli spalti perche non vi erano sufficienti posti a loro disposizione
italian i giornalisti sono stati impediti nello svolgimento delle loro funzioni sono stati picchiati buttati a terra e fermati
italian abbiamo visto nel filmato trasmesso questa mattina qui al parlamento immagini che non lasciano dubbio sulla precisa volont di impedire la libert della stampa vi sono interpretazioni diverse sull evento e per questo chiediamo da parte delle autorit olandesi un indagine per definirne la responsabilit e vogliamo che episodi di questo genere non abbiano mai pi a ripetersi
italian signor presidente il titolo della discussione non hooligan ma euro e mi sembra perfetto
italian l intera europa riuscita ad organizzare una grande festa del calcio in cui le autorit belghe ed olandesi si sono impegnate in prima linea per ottenere tale risultato un enorme massa di tifosi di tutta europa si mobilitata per assistere alle partite
italian tutti avevano tanta paura di possibili violenze e situazioni pericolose
italian in realt il tutto si trasformato su ampia scala in una grande e riuscitissima festa e giustamente la risoluzione sottolinea che ci congratuliamo con le autorit olandesi e belghe per tale successo
italian c poi un ristretto gruppo di hooligan attivi gi da tempo e che mira a guastare simili feste
italian in questo caso ci riuscito soltanto in minima parte solo su alcuni punti
italian ci costa molto denaro spiacevole e pertanto diamo il nostro appoggio alla risoluzione
italian sosteniamo anche l iniziativa dei ministri degli interni olandese e belga tesa a verificare se sia possibile imporre il divieto di viaggiare a questi hooligan in caso di manifestazioni a rischio
italian passiamo al terzo punto l incidente italiano
italian ci che evidente che i colleghi sono stati informati da diverse fonti su quanto avvenuto nello stadio di rotterdam e di conseguenza alcuni hanno l impressione che la situazione sia del tutto sfuggita di mano che si tratti di un fatto molto grave ed in tale prospettiva che si sono formati un opinione altri invece sulla scorta di altre informazioni hanno l impressione che la situazione sia s sfuggita di mano ma non in maniera cos grave
italian ci che reputo fondamental e parlo in qualit di olandese che ovviamente avrebbe desiderato diventare campione d europa e colgo l occasione per congratularmi con i francesi ci che avrei voluto e lo dico anche rivolgendomi ai miei connazionali che se si verificano dei fatti per cui alcuni colleghi ricavano dalle immagini l impressione che ci sia stato qualcosa che non andava allora a non ci comportiamo come se ci riguardi l intera manifestazione di euro e b non ci comportiamo come se ci abbia mandato a monte la festa
italian dobbiamo invece riconoscere che accaduto qualcosa e che vogliamo conoscere i fatti
italian pertanto sono favorevole a che le autorit olandesi procedano ad un indagine approfondita
italian per fortuna il primo ministro kok lo ha promesso ed su tale base che intendo formare il mio giudizio finale
italian desidero come ovvio sin d ora esprimere la mia simpatia e la mia partecipazione ai colleghi italiani ma per formulare un giudizio definitivo intendo attendere di conoscere i fatti
italian signor presidente premetto anzitutto che quest argomento mi tocca molto da vicino infatti ho cominciato ad arbitrare ai massimi livelli diciotto anni fa e sono un tesserato della federazione calcio inglese vorrei inoltre congratularmi con la francia che ha ottenuto una fantastica vittoria ai campionati europei di quest anno e infine sia pure a malincuore congratularmi con la germania cui stata assegnata l organizzazione della coppa del mondo del
italian mi preme soprattutto che il nostro parlamento condanni con estrema severit gli hooligan tutti gli hooligan da qualsiasi paese provengano e quale che sia la loro estrazione sociale
italian riprendo ora l accenno dell onorevole van hecke sul rimpatrio di alcuni tifosi inglesi effettuato con aeroplani c
italian la reazione della polizia belga stata eccessiva e addirittura vergognosa infatti moltissimi appassionati di calcio semplici e inoffensivi sono stati prelevati con la forza dai bar e accomunati cos alla peggior feccia degli hooligan
italian chiediamoci ora quale messaggio hanno trasmesso le autorit calcistiche nei mesi che hanno preceduto i campionati europei
italian i problemi sono iniziati quando l assassinio di due tifosi del leeds in occasione della partita di coppa uefa giocata a istanbul contro il galatasaray rimasto impunito il galatasaray infatti non stato estromesso dalla competizione
italian in occasione della partita fra galatasaray e arsenal giocata in danimarca numerosi tifosi dell arsenal sono stati arrestati ma non sono stati accusati di atti di teppismo
italian dobbiamo poi denunciare l inerzia del governo britannico che ha scelto di non imporre alcuna sanzione supplementare che impedisse di spostarsi all estero almeno agli individui notoriamente pericolosi
italian l intreccio di questi fattori ha indotto molti a pensare questi campionati europei saranno un gioco da ragazzi nessuno ci impedir di andar l a sfasciare tutto mentre invece avrebbero dovuto limitarsi ad assistere a quella che doveva essere una splendida festa del calcio
italian come altre istituzioni non direttamente coinvolte anche il nostro parlamento dovrebbe fare un passo indietro ci si offre ora una pausa di riflessione per ragionare sulle iniziative pi realistiche da intraprendere per combattere il teppismo senza dimenticare per il diritto delle persone di muoversi liberamente in tutto il continente
italian signor presidente vorrei far notare che questa risoluzione ha per titolo euro e non hooligans come appare sulla lavagna
italian e dire che come parlamentari e politici noi abbiamo una grande responsabilit rispetto ai fenomeni sportivi in particolare a quello calcistico quella di ricordare sempre che si tratta di un gioco
italian dobbiamo perci essere preoccupati quando su questo gioco si caricano troppo sia interessi economici sia emotivit eccessive che la politica non deve assolutamente aiutare
italian credo che ai nostri giovani anche a quelli pi tifosi a quelli che investono di pi sentimentalmente in questi eventi dobbiamo sempre ricordare che si tratta di un gioco e quando il gioco bello com stato anche in questi europei credo che sia il grande successo di tutti noi
italian capisco anche perche per le autorit che devono organizzare questi eventi si tratta di eventi particolarmente complessi
italian ci ricordiamo la tragedia dello stadio di heysel per questo credo che ci dobbiamo congratulare per l organizzazione
italian tuttavia in questo quadro positivo ricordiamo l episodio dello stadio di rotterdam anche perche questo avvenuto in una circostanza molto particolare che riguarda la possibilit di accesso di persone handicappate a questi eventi che dovrebbe potersi svolgere con serenit e con accoglienza
italian inoltre ci ha stupito la brutalit della polizia nel colpire i giornalisti che segnalavano un problema molto serio rispetto alla possibilit di accesso e di comportamento delle persone handicappate
italian ribadisco che secondo noi non esiste un clima creato dalle autorit si trattato per di un grave comportamento da parte delle forze dell ordine per cui invito tutti i colleghi a non fare di questo un elemento nazionale perche penso che il contenuto della risoluzione di compromesso pu essere condiviso e votato da tutti
italian grazie onorevoli deputati
italian viste le reiterate allusioni di molti di voi al titolo del punto dell ordine del giorno e affinche non perdiate altro tempo per un equivoco perder io due minuti per chiarire la questione
italian il punto dell ordine del giorno approvato dal plenum hooligan
italian effettivamente il titolo della risoluzione pu essere quello a cui vi state riferendo ma nell ordine del giorno figura come hooligan nell ambito del titolo diritti dell uomo
italian approfitto dell occasione per ribadire per quanto riguarda gli atti che in castigliano hooligan rappresenta un anglicismo usato per indicare un particolare tipo di teppista in generale di origine britannica
italian signor presidente onorevoli colleghi la risoluzione di compromesso che fra poco voteremo mi sembra particolarmente equilibrata
italian in particolare la vicenda di rotterdam non intacca il giudizio sui diritti umani o sulla qualit della democrazia in olanda che reputo tra i paesi pi liberi al mondo ma rimane un brutto episodio sia per l atteggiamento disdicevole nei confronti di portatori di handicap sia per la violenza contro giornalisti che non facevano altro che il proprio dovere
italian poco importa che questi siano italiani o meno
italian l unione europea attraverso la sua massima espressione democratica che il parlamento stigmatizza una vicenda verificatasi al proprio interno
italian questo mi sembra lo spirito pi giusto
italian tutto ci che riguarda gli aspetti nazionali sar oggetto di eventuali azioni dei rispettivi governi e non ci riguarda
italian del resto l unione europea soprattutto con le proprie risoluzioni d urgenza non si esime dall esprimere posizioni rigorose su alcuni paesi o su alcuni episodi verificatisi in ogni parte del pianeta nei quali non vengono rispettati i diritti umani
italian quale credibilit avrebbe essa in tale sua azione se non fosse capace di riconoscere episodi del genere anche al proprio interno
italian signor presidente per quanto riguarda i campionati sar telegrafico la francia meritatamente campione europeo e la paura che la situazione potesse sfuggire di mano non ha trovato riscontro nella realt nonostante alcuni incidenti di cui ha riferito l onorevole van hecke che hanno coinvolto in particolare i sostenitori inglesi
italian al termine della final ed su questo che rischia di incentrarsi l intera discussione anche se non si pu fare altr sono avvenuti dei fatti sui quali a mio giudizio non si pu chiudere un occhio e mi riferisco in particolare al trattamento dur fin troppo dur riservato ai giornalisti
italian a mio parere poliziotti e assistenti troppo nervosi hanno chiaramente passato i limiti
italian ma su quanto successo prima e su quella che stata la causa scatenante c ancora molta incertezza
italian che cosa accaduto veramente ai disabili italiani
italian si sapeva che ne sarebbero giunti tanti
italian lo dico in veste di frequentatore abituale dello stadio di rotterdam e so che l c s posto per tifosi portatori di handicap ma non per un numero illimitato di disabili
italian questi tifosi non volevano oppure non dovevano essere ripresi dalle telecamere
italian bisogna trovare una risposta a questi interrogativi e il governo olandese ha promesso di procedere ad un indagine al riguardo
italian fino a che non saranno pubblicati i risultati di tale indagine mi asterr dal formulare qualsiasi giudizio
italian pertanto il mio gruppo voter contro le parti della risoluzione in cui invece gi stato espresso un giudizio
italian desidero lanciare un accorato appello ai colleghi e alla stampa italiani ma in particolare ai colleghi italiani affinche non si paragoni la vicenda di rotterdam con il dramma dell heysel che non assolutamente il caso
italian facendolo si mettono solo in dubbio le gravi questioni che devono ancora essere vagliate
italian suggerisco quanto segue accaduto qualcosa si far un indagine a tale proposito ma per favore guardiamo le cose nelle loro giuste dimensioni
italian signor presidente la ringrazio di aver ricordato che il titolo del punto dell ordine del giorno che stiamo affrontando il fenomeno degli hooligan
italian due mesi fa presentai un interrogazione al parlamento sulla necessit di intervenire contro le violenze che gli hooligan avrebbero sicuramente commesso in occasione di euro
italian le misure adottate dalle autorit belghe hanno permesso di attenuare le violenze chiaramente razziste xenofobe e contro gli omosessuali degli hooligan
italian e indispensabile capire quali mezzi debbano essere adottati per neutralizzare gli autori di tali atti di violenza spesso manipolati da movimenti di estrema destra
italian e ancora troppo facile per gli hooligan spostarsi impunemente all interno dei paesi dell unione
italian dovrebbero essere previste sanzioni immediate nei paesi in cui gli hooligan commettono dei crimini
italian coloro che sono identificati e schedati per aver commesso atti di aggressione non devono essere autorizzati a entrare negli stadi durante le grandi manifestazioni sportive
italian i club di calcio e di tifosi devono essere maggiormente responsabilizzati perch bisogna riconoscerl per il momento soffiano sul fuoco
italian il ministro francese per la giovent e lo sport marie georges buffet ha promosso un azione di responsabilizzazione che sta dando i suoi frutti
italian ritengo che il parlamento possa avere un vero e proprio ruolo di stimolo presso gli stati membri e l uefa affinche tali misure siano di applicazione immediata il cartellino rosso deve valere in campo ma anche per gli hooligan dentro e fuori gli stadi
italian signor presidente onorevoli colleghi devono essere condannate tutte le forme di violenza anche le biasimevoli espressioni di hooliganismo manifestatesi in occasione di euro
italian ad ogni modo non posso fare a meno di pensare che i riprovevoli incidenti verificatisi siano stati ingigantiti a dismisura sia da una parte della stampa sia da una parte della classe politica
italian pertanto non stata sottolineata a sufficienza la buona organizzazione di euro un organizzazione che rimarr per molti milioni di persone un ricordo indelebile
italian in qualit di rappresentante di uno dei due paesi organizzatori mi congratulo con tutti coloro che sono stati impegnati nell organizzazione e nel mantenimento dell ordine pubblico
italian la riuscita di euro ha dimostrato che piccoli paesi sono in grado di compiere grandi azioni il successo di euro non dev essere offuscato dall atteggiamento vandalico di una minoranza
italian tutti gli stati membri devono di comune accordo adottare misure adeguate
italian euro non stata soltanto una grande festa del calcio ma anche della fratellanza e della solidariet tra i cittadini dell unione europea
italian signor presidente luned il gruppo eldr ha votato contro l iscrizione di questo punto all ordine del giorno leggendo la risoluzione penso che avevamo ragione
italian naturalmente bello congratularsi in una risoluzione ma non mi sembra che sia questo il compito del parlamento
italian l argomento hooligan non pu essere definito urgente in quanto un fenomeno che si manifesta gi da anni importante trattarlo anche da parte del parlamento ma non va discusso come un problema urgente
italian c poi la questione dei fatti di rotterdam
italian e ovvio che necessario condurre un indagine dato che le accuse mosse sono assai gravi
italian se una troupe televisiva stata trattenuta in stato di fermo per una notte indispensabile indagare in maniera approfondita e bisogna scoprire se ci siano state delle valide ragioni per farlo
italian le indagini sono in corso
italian il procuratore olandese se ne sta occupando e pertanto del tutto prematuro che il parlamento esprima un giudizio al riguardo a mio parere non il momento di farlo
italian ritengo che sia fuori luogo tranciare un giudizio politico nel momento in cui un procuratore sta vagliando i fatti
italian penso che anche gli emendamenti relativi a questa vicenda debbano essere respinti
italian potremo ritornare sulla questione quando risulter che effettivamente accaduto qualcosa che possa avere a che fare con una violazione dei diritti umani ma credo che a voler esprimere sin d ora un simile giudizio ci si spinga troppo in l
italian signor presidente vorrei innanzi tutto rivolgermi al collega heaton harris che circa un mese fa aveva creduto di dover vietare la manifestazione sportiva a charleroi perche riteneva che si sarebbero verificati gravi episodi di violenza
italian a lui che stato arbitro direi sportivamente che avevo fatto bene allora a fischiarlo
italian in secondo luogo ritengo che sia necessario considerare con attenzione la questione infatti se riuscissimo come indica la risoluzione a raggiungere una maggiore cooperazione tra i diversi stati membri in occasione di manifestazioni come questa faremmo un passo in avanti
italian se un domani riuscissimo ad ottenere che gli hooligan recidivi non siano pi autorizzati ad assistere agli incontri e se infine come ricordava poc anzi l onorevole sylla avessimo la possibilit di continuare a seguire da vicino un tema come questo per inaugurare una nuova pedagogia sul comportamento negli stadi sarebbe lo sport a vincere e non l inquietudine politica
italian concludo signor presidente augurandomi che il contenuto e il modo in cui ho presentato questa riflessione avessero una dimensione umana come da lei auspicato
italian iraq
italian signor presidente le nazioni unite sono state indebolite da due membri del consiglio di sicurezza per quanto riguarda le sanzioni all iraq
italian kofi annan un uomo retto e giusto ma dovrebbe comunque dare le dimissioni nella consapevolezza che il mondo decisamente contrario all eccessiva severit delle sanzioni
italian l unione europea deve levare la propria voce e protestare contro sanzioni che equivalgono a un genocidio virtuale
italian lo scopo presunto di tali sanzioni di sbarazzarsi di saddam hussein dieci anni dopo l imposizione delle sanzioni egli ancora al potere
italian in realt il vero scopo delle sanzioni di controllare gli approvvigionamenti petroliferi e di garantire una zona di addestramento ai piloti statunitensi e britannici in modo da assicurare la sopravvivenza dei complessi militari industriali dei due paesi
italian in occasione della mia recente visita in iraq ho visto bambini morire di infezioni respiratorie dissenteria leucemia gastroenterite e denutrizione
italian dobbiamo ricordare che questo paese dispone della seconda riserva petrolifera al mondo
italian nelle sale operatorie ci sono infiltrazioni di liquami e attrezzature antiquate
italian stiamo assistendo al lento soffocamento di una nazione e di un popolo meravigliosi
italian sono un amico dell islam e credo che l unione europea e questo parlamento debbano smettere di demonizzare gli arabi e l islam
italian signor presidente inizialmente avevamo presentato un testo sullo stesso argomento e della medesima portata ma pi ricco di sfumature rispetto alla cosiddetta risoluzione comune
italian avrei di gran lunga preferito discutere un testo con pi sfumature
italian come mai il nostro testo non compare
italian eppure noi abbiamo ritirato la nostra firma
italian a nostro giudizio il testo originale da noi presentato avrebbe potuto fungere assai meglio da base per la discussione
italian onorevole maes forse non ci siamo capiti bene ma se avete ritirato la vostra firma dalla risoluzione comune oppure non la avete firmata il testo continuer ad essere in discussione e verr sottoposto a votazione secondo le regole stabilite
italian verr distribuito e forse a disposizione
italian noto infatti che molti colleghi non hanno visto il testo in questione
italian s certamente
italian non sapevamo che esistesse un problema di distribuzione ma se lo dice lei lo verificheremo e distribuiremo il testo
italian signor presidente la guerra tra iraq e iran durata dal al in quel conflitto gli stati uniti e l unione europea hanno appoggiato l iraq perche consideravamo l iran la vera minaccia per il medio oriente
italian l iraq ha invaso il kuwait il agosto con un azione ingiusta e inaccettabile l onu ha risposto con la risoluzione imponendo sanzioni all iraq
italian l azione dell onu era giustificata
italian nell aprile gli stati uniti e la gran bretagna hanno imposto una no fly zone
italian nel l iraq ha riconosciuto l integrit territoriale del kuwait
italian dal al gli ispettori dell on
italian unsco hanno ispezionato distrutto e verificato sistematicamente e su larga scala la capacit irachena di produrre armi di distruzione di massa
italian nel l onu stata informata dal proprio rappresentante che il lavoro dell unscom si era esteso in pratica all intero iraq
italian nel l agenzia internazionale per l energia atomica ha dichiarato che la capacit nucleare dell iraq era ormai inesistente
italian il programma oil for food avviato nel stato caratterizzato da un eccessiva burocrazia e da una generale incompetenza provocando gravi ritardi negli approvvigionamenti dei farmaci essenziali e dei prodotti alimentari
italian dei miliardi di dollari di proventi petroliferi accumulati in tre anni soltanto miliardi sono stati utilizzati per le importazioni mentre miliardi sono ancora congelati in una banca di new york
italian se lo scopo delle sanzioni era di distruggere la capacit militare dell iraq l obiettivo stato raggiunto se invece miravano a sbarazzarsi di saddam hussein dopo dieci anni questa meta ancora lontana
italian tuttavia dieci anni di sanzioni hanno provocato immense sofferenze e privazioni ai milioni di iracheni alta mortalit infantile ridotte aspettative di vita maggiore incidenza del cancro e delle malattie curabili continuano a devastare il tessuto sociale di un paese che un tempo godeva di un alto tenore di vita
italian l embargo intellettuale ha impedito a medici insegnanti e altri professionisti di godere dei progressi scientifici e tecnologici
italian credo che l unione europea debba rivedere la propria posizione aiutando coloro che soffrono maggiormente attualmente sei stati membri dell unione hanno una rappresentanza diplomatica in iraq germania francia italia spagna portogallo e grecia
italian i diplomatici di questi paesi condividono l opinione dell ufficio delle nazioni unite in iraq dell organizzazione mondiale della sanit della croce rossa e di altre organizzazioni non governative attraverso l attivit diplomatica l unione potr ottenere una vera svolta
italian i nostri deputati e i funzionari della commissione devono recarsi in iraq in missioni esplorative per incontrare i rappresentanti del parlamento iracheno i diplomatici dell ue le agenzie internazionali e le ong
italian questo dialogo contribuir a stabilire quale sia la realt odierna e ad individuare il modo di rompere l impasse per eliminare le sanzioni nel settore degli approvvigionamenti non militari
italian spero che il parlamento voter a favore di questa risoluzione
italian signor presidente a dimostrazione del fatto che il perpetuarsi delle sanzioni contro l iraq provoca gravi problemi baster ricordare il gran numero di dimissioni di funzionari d alto livello delle nazioni unite possiamo anche notare le parole di mary robinson che ha aspramente condannato le conseguenze delle sanzioni
italian il bombardamento illegittimo ad opera degli stati uniti e della gran bretagna non contemplato da alcuna risoluzione del consiglio di sicurezza dell onu non previsto da alcun mandato ed decisamente vergognoso non possiamo permettere che vada avanti
italian la nostra acquiescenza per la continuazione di questo bombardamento ha dell incredibile
italian le infrastrutture irachene sono state completamente distrutte anche in questo caso le vittime sono persone innocenti prive di ogni potere
italian in quest occasione devo congratularmi con alcune organizzazioni delle nostre comunit che stanno facendo qualcosa in proposito o stanno cercando di diffondere una maggiore consapevolezza del problema queste voci nel deserto che si oppongono alle sanzioni stanno svolgendo un ruolo essenziale e vorrei offrire loro tutto il mio appoggio
italian dobbiamo anche ricordare che qualunque tipo di misura venga adottata in futuro contro l iraq dobbiamo cercare di salvaguardare i diritti umani e la democrazia dobbiamo inoltre proteggere i curdi al nord e gli sciiti al sud per garantire loro qualche forma di autonomia
italian non possiamo certo dimenticarci di queste popolazioni
italian signor presidente il aprile dopo un dibattito approfondito con consiglio e commissione abbiamo varato una risoluzione cui la stragrande maggioranza di questo parlamento ha potuto esprimere il suo appoggio
italian in tale risoluzione ci appellavamo a consiglio e commissione affinche facessero il possibile per risparmiare l esistenza e la salute del popolo iracheno e per mettere fine alle sue sofferenze
italian chiedevamo l abolizione dell embargo anche per generi alimentari e medicinali perche esso colpisce non gi saddam hussein bens il popolo iracheno
italian esortavamo a far cessare immediatamente i bombardamenti che stati uniti e regno unito stanno compiendo senza alcun mandato da parte del consiglio di sicurezza dell onu perche anche questi colpiscono e puniscono in iraq non i colpevoli ma le vittime
italian ovviamente gi all inizio della risoluzione confermavamo e sottolineavamo la necessit che il governo iracheno si impegnasse ad accettare e favorire il controllo da parte delle nazioni unite sulla distruzione delle armi abc e a contribuire a far luce sul destino delle persone scomparse in kuwait
italian con la discussione di oggi e con la nuova proposta ci prefiggiamo altri tre obbiettivi
italian innanzi tutto vogliamo integrare l appello a consiglio e commissione con una pari esortazione al consiglio di sicurezza delle nazioni unite
italian secondo proponiamo che questa assemblea operi di sua iniziativa e intraprenda sul posto una fact finding mission
italian terzo desideriamo confermare che le nazioni unite l organizzazione mondiale per la sanit e la croce rossa in iraq stanno operando affinche i pi bisognosi ed i pi deboli possano trarre beneficio dall attuale programma oil for food
italian signor presidente premesso che al pari dell onorevole andrews mi considero amico del mondo arabo ed islamico voglio dire che il nucleo fondamentale di tutta la risoluzione senza il quale essa non pu essere accolta risieda nel considerando a e nel primo paragrafo ove si afferma che solo il rispetto delle risoluzioni delle nazioni unite da parte dell iraq pu condurre ad un allentamento delle sanzioni
italian in particolare si chiede all iraq di cooperare con il comitato internazionale della croce rossa per rintracciare i cittadini kuwaitiani scomparsi dopo l illegittima occupazione del paese da parte dell iraq
italian nel caso di una visita dell unione europea in iraq essa dovrebbe prevedere un incontro con le famiglie del kuwait che da dieci anni stanno attendendo di sapere cosa sia accaduto ai loro cari
italian una posizione pi morbida da parte europea non sarebbe di alcun aiuto per il popolo iracheno il quale sarebbe anzi cos condannato a subire una tirannia eterna
italian signor presiedente un minuto veramente poco per un tema cos grave
italian dico grave perche abbiamo a che fare ne pi ne meno con la sopravvivenza di un popolo e con un atto che si deve chiamar come fece tempo fa un ministro della difesa francese chev nemen una spedizione punitiva internazionale contro una nazione che osava sottrarsi al nuovo ordine mondiale
italian un atto come questo di cattivo auspicio per il futuro
italian il nuovo ordine mondiale espressione di bush per nascondere gli interessi delle grandi multinazionali e in questo caso dei petrolieri americani per noi sempre pi intollerabile
italian ci stupiamo del silenzio delle associazioni umanitarie di fronte alla situazione degli iracheni che soffrono e muoiono le vittime sono ormai pi di un milione per mano nostra
italian che contrasto e che ipocrisia tra l umanitarismo e questo olocausto del quale siamo tutti responsabili collettivamente a causa della pura e semplice codardia di fronte alla potenza americana il parlamento in particolare e l europa in generale non sono capaci di opporsi a questo grande impero su alcun tema come si visto ancora ieri nella votazione su echelon
italian il fatto pi grave e con questo concludo perche ci sarebbero decisamente troppe cose da dire che per una volta un paese del sud riusciva a svilupparsi e i paesi del nord allineati dietro a washington non hanno esitato a distruggerlo
italian e un fatto estremamente grave ed inquietante per il secolo che comincia
italian signor presidente chi mai potrebbe non provare simpatia per la popolazione irachena cos duramente provata
italian parto dal presupposto che questa sia la molla che ha spinto coloro che hanno presentato la risoluzione comune
italian l effetto politico del loro intento un occasione fallita anzi per la parte curda liberata dell antica mesopotamia assolutamente catastrofico
italian voglio essere concreto
italian in pieno contrasto con quanto lasciano supporre i consideranda b e c l odierna personificazione di nabucodonosor ossia saddam hussein ha gi distrutto l antica civilt da lui tanto ammirata
italian basta pensare alla prima e alla seconda guerra del golfo e aggiungere ancora cinque anni ossia il periodo in cui baghdad si rifiutata categoricamente di collaborare al programma oil for food causando il protrarsi del tutto inutile delle sofferenze da parte della popolazione
italian attualmente il governo iracheno pu persino esportare petrolio senza limitazioni per acquistare beni umanitari
italian in breve che cosa fa saddam per lenire le sofferenze dei suoi conterranei
italian che cosa accadr del percento riservato ai curdi se le sanzioni verranno inopinatamente cancellate
italian trovo alquanto bizzarro l uso dello strano termine embargo intellettuale di cui al considerando d
italian in effetti l intellighenzia irachena soffre gi da anni a causa dell embargo intellettuale imposto dal baath il partito di saddam
italian il tiranno del tigri infatti interessato ad un unico tipo di scienziato quello che mette a punto armi per la distruzione di massa
italian proprio questa ossessione di saddam hussein mette a nudo la pericolosa ingenuit del paragrafo della risoluzione comune in quanto l abolizione della no fly zone nel nord dell iraq ossia la garanzia internazionale che tutela i curdi dal loro nemico mortale saddam costringer probabilmente milioni di curdi a darsi di nuovo alla fuga
italian essi infatti sanno fin troppo bene che valore abbiano le promesse di saddam
italian e impossibile che coloro che hanno presentato la risoluzione comune mirino ad una simile prospettiva spaventosa
italian perci respingo con decisione il documento
italian signor presidente mi si consenta di dire che la risposta della commissione e la maniera sbrigativa con cui essa ha trattato la questione dell iraq mi hanno lasciato sconvolto e indignato
italian voglio citare a beneficio del commissario e della commissione tutta quel detto di oscar wilde secondo il quale nelle cose della nostra vita il destino non chiude mai il suo libro
italian l iraq merita ben pi della risposta fornita dalla commissione
italian sono davvero indignato
italian desidero esprimere la mia pi totale insoddisfazione per la risposta fornita dalla commissione e non ho altro da aggiungere
italian a voler essere giusti signor presidente mi si deve concedere di esprimere la mia pi totale soddisfazione per la risposta fornita dalla commissione
italian perfetto c stato un turno a favore e uno contrario
italian ringraziamo il signor commissario che non desidera intervenire
italian dobbiamo essere brevi e andare avanti
italian la discussione chiusa
italian la votazione si svolger alle
italian venezuela
italian l ordine del giorno reca in discussione congiunta le seguenti proposte di risoluzione
italian b presentata dagli onorevoli di pietro e sanchez garcia a nome del gruppo eldr sul venezuela
italian b presentata dagli onorevoli salafranca sanchez neyra e altri a nome del gruppo ppe de sulla ricostruzione e la ripresa delle regioni colpite dalle catastrofiche inondazioni abbattutesi sul venezuela nel dicembre l
italian b presentata dagli onorevoli wurtz e altri a nome del gruppo gue ngl sul venezuela
italian b presentata dagli onorevoli frassoni e kn rr borr s a nome del gruppo verts ale sulla ricostruzione delle regioni colpite nel dicembre dalle inondazioni in venezuela
italian b presentata dagli onorevoli linkohr e menendez del valle a nome del gruppo pse sulla ricostruzione delle regioni colpite nel dicembre dalle inondazioni in venezuela
italian signor presidente onorevoli colleghi oggi abbiamo l opportunit di dimostrare la nostra solidariet al popolo venezuelano che nel dicembre dell anno scorso sub le conseguenze del disastro naturale che colp il litorale degli stati di vargs e miranda e caus la morte di persone
italian per questo insistiamo nel ribadire l importanza che riveste l approvazione di questa risoluzione la quale in definitiva rappresenta la conseguenza logica della relazione della commissione speciale che si recata in venezuela per conoscere sul posto la realt del disastro naturale e riflette la coerenza degli impegni politici presi dall unione europea
italian mi auguro che sia cos possibile finanziare in modo significativo il programma di ripresa delle zone colpite e che si proceda seguendo gli schemi di questo tipo di azione
italian allo stesso modo sarebbe opportuno che si tenesse conto per il coordinamento dei programmi di aiuti finanziari degli stati membri e delle regioni comunitarie
italian signor presidente come ha appena ricordato l onorevole sanchez garcia questa risoluzione rientra nell ambito della decisione della conferenza dei presidenti di inviare una missione ad hoc in venezuela per fare un bilancio delle tragiche conseguenze delle inondazioni avvenute nel mese di dicembre in quel paese
italian il caso venezuelano grave e richiede misure urgenti
italian e grave perche si calcol e non si ha ancora un bilancio definitivo delle vittim che in questa tragedia abbiano perso la vita pi di persone
italian richiede misure urgenti perche signor presidente la missione del parlamento europeo risale al mese di febbraio e fino ad oggi non siamo stati in grado di giungere a delle conclusioni definitive
italian credo che qui sia in gioco la credibilit del parlamento
italian approfitto della presenza della commissione per chiedere al signor commissario che ci illustri il modo in cui la commissione ha svolto il mandato affidatole dal parlamento nella risoluzione approvata nel mese di gennaio in cui si chiedeva che venisse fatta una valutazione della risposta comunitaria alla tragedia che aveva colpito il venezuela
italian spero che la commissione sia in grado di mobilitare le risorse umane necessarie per rispettare le priorit indicate dal parlamento e sono sicuro che se la commissione come stato proposto nella sua bozza di bilancio del pu permettersi di spendere milioni di euro nei balcani potr anche spendere almeno milioni di euro in venezuela
italian la questione signor presidente pone un problema che va oltre la risoluzione sul venezuela
italian il problema consiste nel conservare la capacit di risposta del parlamento a questo tipo di situazioni
italian signor presidente deve essere chiaro ci che vogliamo vogliamo un parlamento vero e proprio o vogliamo un parlamento di cartapesta
italian vogliamo un parlamento che sia in grado di assumersi pienamente le proprie responsabilit o vogliamo un parlamento che si occupi di avallare le priorit di altre istituzioni
italian vogliamo un parlamento in grado di adempiere alle proprie responsabilit o vogliamo un parlamento che si occupi di firmare l assegno per impegni presi da altre istituzioni
italian e questo il dibattito per il bilancio dell anno e questo stato il dibattito sostenuto per il bilancio dell anno
italian quello che voglio semplicemente dire signor presidente che quando c la volont si trova sempre la strada e che questa risoluzione rispecchia l impegno assunto dal parlamento di manifestare la propria volont che quella di aiutare e di esprimere solidariet la solidariet dell unione europea con la societ e con la popolazione del venezuela
italian sono convinto signor presidente che grazie a questa volont saremo capaci di trovare in un bilancio in cui quest anno figurano milioni di euro e in cui figureranno cifre simili nei prossimi anni una strada per andare incontro ai bisogni delle vittime di questa tragedia
italian signor presidente le tre questioni che il gruppo confederale della sinistra unitaria europea sinistra verde nordica desidera sottolineare sugli aiuti che l unione europea pu e deve dare al venezuela a seguito della terribile catastrofe provocata dalle inondazioni sono in primo luogo dedicarsi con risorse economiche e tecniche a trovare una soluzione alla conseguenze e non diminuire gli aiuti come richiede la commissione per far fronte finanziariamente ad un altra catastrofe questa volta artificiale provocata da noi nel kosovo e in jugoslavia nei balcani
italian in secondo luogo ratificare e applicare le condizioni e le decisioni del vertice di kyoto per ridurre l emissione degli agenti che inquinano l atmosfera producendo l effetto serra e quindi i cambiamenti climatici e i conseguenti danni
italian e in terzo luogo dimostrare la solidariet dell unione europea al venezuela e in generale all america latina affinche si possano cos contrastare gli effetti negativi del peso del nord del continente sul resto
italian signor presidente desidero esprimere il nostro completo appoggio a questa risoluzione che parla di solidariet con il popolo venezuelano e desidero farlo avanzando alcuni punti
italian in primo luogo abbiamo una richiesta da fare vale a dire che i soccorsi arrivino effettivamente alle persone e ai gruppi che pi ne hanno bisogno
italian come gruppo non ci opponiamo logicamente al fatto che si parli come si sta facendo delle pmi e dell industria in generale ma ci sembra eccessivo che se ne parli con questo zelo mentre invece si tace di altri gruppi che si trovano in maggiore difficolt
italian soprattutto come ha indicato l onorevole salafranca necessario che le misure adottate per gli aiuti siano efficaci e non risentano della mancanza di risorse umane
italian in secondo luogo desideriamo denunciare il fatto che non sia stato accettato un principio tanto elementare per il nostro gruppo come quello di coinvolgere le popolazioni colpite nella programmazione e applicazione delle misure di aiuto affinche non ci si trovi alla fine a fare cose che non sono necessarie o che non sono state chieste
italian infine last but not least necessario riflettere sul nostro modo di produrre e sul nostro modo di consumare le risorse naturali poiche questo alla base delle catastrofi e tale riflessone ci pu aiutare a non dover constatare ciclicamente e tristemente che si sono verificate
italian signor presidente non voglio dire che il fatto che in questa assemblea si sia sviluppata una sensibilit particolare verso la regione latino americana impedisca che si appoggino anche gli sforzi che la commissione sta facendo nei confronti dell europa centro orientale e per la ricostruzione dei balcani
italian quello che ci preoccupa in questo momento la sensazione che nell ultimo anno la nuova commissione abbia abbandonato il suo interesse verso quella zona
italian e come se improvvisamente l america latina fosse scomparsa dalla carta geografica delle preoccupazioni della commissione
italian senza dubbio il contributo dell unione europea alla regione centro americana dopo la catastrofe del mitch ha costituito un esperienza positiva come positiva stata la reazione iniziale della commissione che si precipitata a destinare euro per gli aiuti umanitari di emergenza al venezuela quando avvenuta la catastrofe citata dagli oratori che mi hanno preceduto
italian sappiamo che in questo momento la commissione ha la possibilit i mezzi le risorse per offrire un aiuto pi consistente
italian sfortunatamente questo tipo di disgrazie stanno avvenendo con una certa frequenza e ho l impressione che la regione latino americana utilizzi bene gli aiuti comunitari
italian possiamo contare su strumenti mezzi bravi rappresentanti e possiamo contare anche sulla presenza europea in quelle zone
italian bisogna ricordare per esempio che l unione europea il maggior investitore straniero in venezuela e che abbiamo molti legami culturali e sociali con quei paesi
italian spero quindi che la commissione accolga con la migliore disponibilit e volont le petizioni avanzate dal parlamento e che con le risorse disponibili e con quelle che si possono mobilitare in tempi brevi prenda in debita considerazione tali petizioni ed elabori un piano che non si limiti all aiuto umanitario essenziale bens contribuisca ad aiutare anche quel paese che sta facendo un grosso sforzo a realizzare la ricostruzione per il bene suo e probabilmente anche per il bene nostro dal momento che il continente che pu trarre maggior beneficio dallo sviluppo dell america latina probabilmente proprio quello europeo
italian signor presidente sono passati ormai pi di sei mesi dalle tragiche inondazioni verificatesi in venezuela
italian la delegazione ad hoc del parlamento europeo ha avuto l opportunit di vedere gli effetti terribili di quella che considerata la pi grande catastrofe naturale mai avvenuta in america latina
italian bisogna vedere per credere per quanto impressionanti siano state le fotografie e le immagini televisive divulgate dai media esse danno solo una pallida idea delle reali dimensioni del disastro
italian abbiamo avuto anche l opportunit di costatare l inestimabile azione di solidariet delle organizzazioni non governative nei confronti delle popolazioni colpite dalle inondazioni
italian questo aiuto umanitario d emergenza prestato dalle ong non sarebbe stato possibile senza l appoggio finanziario della commissione a tutti quelli che lo hanno reso possibile va la mia pi profonda stima
italian ora tuttavia la priorit deve essere la ricostruzione di tutta la zona colpita nonche lo stimolo della ripresa economica
italian nel quadro di una nuova pianificazione territoriale necessario ricostruire le abitazioni e tutti i tipi di infrastrutture nonche incentivare le piccole e medie imprese che si sono viste distruggere tutto a ricominciare in molti casi da zero
italian sono consapevole che il prezzo della ricostruzione colossale
italian forse questo il motivo del ritardo
italian sono state sgombrate appena alcune strade stata disciplinata con qualche provvedimento la fornitura di acqua e di elettricit e poco pi le persone colpite sono disperate per il ritardo anche perche migliaia di loro continuano a dipendere dagli aiuti alimentari per la propria sopravvivenza
italian e fondamentale creare le migliaia di posti di lavoro persi a causa delle inondazioni
italian il governo venezuelano ha bisogno di un grande sostegno per promuovere questo lavoro ciclopico
italian la commissione per ci che riguarda il prezzo della ricostruzione che improrogabile deve agire con la stessa solidariet con cui ha agito in occasione della fornitura di aiuti umanitari d emergenza o come quando ha aiutato i paesi colpiti dal ciclone mitch
italian chiediamo quindi alla commissione di compiere un significativo sforzo finanziario nei prossimi cinque anni
italian oltre a un dovere elementare di solidariet lo esigono i rapporti storici che ci legano al venezuela e la stabilit democratica in quel paese
italian innanzi tutto desidero precisare che a differenza delle affermazioni fatte qui in assemblea la commissione valuta moltissimo l importanza politica dell america latina e proprio di recente ha intrapreso una serie di iniziative che sottolineano quanto l america latina sia politicamente importante per l europa
italian in secondo luogo desidero osservare che anche in occasione della catastrofe verificatasi in venezuela opportuno riflettere sulle cause e sugli effetti e sulle responsabilit collegate
italian in fin dei conti l unione ha dato fin dall inizio aiuti di vasta portata e continuer a farlo
italian due sono gli aspetti di questi aiuti
italian da un lato si tratta di sostenere la ricostruzione nello stato federale di varga oggi gi possibile vedere con maggiore chiarezza quali sono le esigenze reali all inizio non era cos
italian posso ben capire che ci sia una certa impazienza perche a volte le cose si muovono con lentezza
italian dal governo venezuelano per non sono arrivate proposte di progetti
italian sia chiaro non c critica nelle mie parole probabilmente per il governo venezuelano difficile decidere in tempi molto rapidi quali siano le priorit
italian per questa ragione inizialmente abbiamo dovuto inviare una commissione di esperti in venezuela affinche verificassero in modo diretto quali potevano essere le priorit
italian i risultati sono ora disponibili
italian fra qualche giorno verr inviata una comunicazione al consiglio con indicazioni su quali siano i provvedimenti da adottare e con quanto danaro vadano finanziati
italian il secondo aspetto a mio avviso ancora pi importante degli aiuti alla ricostruzione l aiuto a prevenire le catastrofi
italian noi vogliamo dare il nostro contributo affinche si decidano e si avviino programmi dedicati alla gestione dei rischi naturali negli stati federali di falcon miranda e jarakui
italian nell ambito della prevenzione delle catastrof abbiamo dovuto impararlo proprio dalla catastrofe venezuelan c ancora molto da migliorare
italian io credo che l aiuto pi valido che possiamo dare a quelle genti consista nel concentrarsi su questo aspetto
italian la questione della dotazione finanziaria di queste due misure molto complessa la commissione riceve continuamente da consiglio e parlamento indicazioni su ci che deve fare e su chi deve aiutare ma nessuno dice mai alla commissione dove trover il denaro per fare tutto ci
italian come ben sapete noi della commissione non possiamo battere moneta
italian troveremo un modo per finanziare queste attivit e faremo delle proposte realistiche anche proposte sul tipo di contributo che il paese stesso in grado di dare grazie ai proventi dell esportazione del petrolio che sono aumentati notevolmente
italian la ringrazio signor commissario
italian la discussione congiunta chiusa
italian la votazione si svolger alle
italian osservatorio europeo contro il razzismo e la xenofobia
italian l ordine del giorno reca in discussione congiunta le seguenti proposte di risoluzione
italian b presentata dall onorevole van velzen a nome del gruppo ppe de sulla polemica sull osservatorio europeo contro il razzismo e la xenofobia
italian b presentata dagli onorevoli wurtz e altri a nome del gruppo gue ngl sulle dimissioni del professor pelinka rappresentante austriaco nel consiglio di amministrazione dell osservatorio europeo contro il razzismo e la xenofobia
italian b presentata dall onorevole ford e altri a nome del gruppo pse sulle dimissioni del professor pelinka rappresentante austriaco nel consiglio di amministrazione dell osservatorio europeo contro il razzismo e la xenofobia
italian signor presidente condivido l opinione dell onorevole watson presidente della commissione per le libert civili e i diritti dei cittadini la giustizia e gli affari interni il quale in un intervista ha affermato che la proposta d urgenza presentata dall onorevole swoboda la via sbagliata e che egli si aspetta un comportamento pi maturo
italian sono d accordo con questa affermazione perche in una motivazione presentata al parlamento l onorevole swoboda faceva riferimento a conflitti ben anteriori fra il governo austriaco e la direttrice dell osservatorio europeo contro il razzismo conflitti risalenti all epoca in cui viktor klima uomo dell sp era a capo del governo austriaco e tale governo era dominato dall sp
italian se un socialista austriaco fa una cosa simile si crea una situazione delicata ma assolutamente non urgente
italian condivido le parole dell onorevole watson perche l onorevole swoboda conferma al governo attuale che le relazioni con l osservatorio stanno rifiorendo
italian dovrebbe rallegrarsene come faccio io e come fanno molti altri
italian questo non un motivo per un urgenza ed ancor meno d motivo d urgenza il fatto che io citi qui parole pronunciate dalla direttrice dell osservatorio in un intervista da lei stessa autorizzata
italian la direttrice loda esplicitamente la nuova politica estera dell austria e concede al governo che ovviamente non c stata nemmeno una iniziativa xenofoba ma che al contrario si stanno registrando molti progressi
italian afferma inoltre che tali progressi non erano stati possibili con il governo rosso nero ma anche che naturalmente non viene ostacolata nel suo lavoro
italian cosa vuol dire dunque tutto questo onorevole swoboda
italian evidentemente lei come socialista austriaco vuole semplicemente gettare le basi per una polemica contro l austria
italian e una cosa vergognosa e decisamente deplorevole per un austriaco
italian signor presidente mi scuso con gli interpreti se poc anzi ho parlato troppo velocemente
italian vorrei intervenire a proposito delle dimissioni del professor pelinka dal consiglio d amministrazione dell osservatorio di vienna
italian ritengo che quello che accaduto a pelinka docente universitario di chiara fama rispettato dalla comunit scientifica rivelatore della vera natura della coalizione al potere in austria
italian l estrema destra soprattutto quando al potere abile nell arte di esasperare gli oppositori
italian ci che accaduto al professor pelinka non ne una coincidenza ne un caso
italian si cominciato con il calunniarlo lo si poi perseguitato mediante una sentenza iniqua emessa da un giudice agli ordini dell fp visto che l attuale ministro della giustizia dell fp era l avvocato di j rg haider nel caso di diffamazione contro il professor pelinka
italian infine l attivit dell osservatorio stata resa impossibile mediante una campagna di pressione pubblica contro i suoi membri
italian ritengo che haide dobbiamo esserne consapevol stia mostrando il proprio sprezzo per le sanzioni che l unione europea gli impone attualmente infatti quando la presidenza portoghese prese l iniziativa di proporre la nomina di tre saggi egli decise di reagire indicendo un referendum per la cessazione delle sanzioni un referendum chiaramente demagogico populista e antieuropeo
italian inoltre questa una sfida che j rg haider lancia alla comunit intera
italian ci ricorda che l osservatorio una creazione dell unione europea e che il nostro presidente era presente all inaugurazione tre mesi fa
italian questa la riprova per quanti ancora avessero dubbi che non bisogna venire a patti con l estrema destra perche ogni piccola vittoria che essa ottiene la rende pi forte e pi accettabile
italian non sar certo perche l unione europea ammorbidisce le proprie posizioni sull austria che haider e i suoi amici cominceranno miracolosamente a difendere i diritti dell uomo e a rinnegare la loro ideologia
italian in risposta dobbiamo accordare il nostro totale appoggio al professor pelinka e parimenti sostenere l osservatorio sul piano umano politico e finanziario infine gli stati membri devono continuare a isolare il governo austriaco e pur mantenendo il nostro appoggio al popolo austriaco isolare questa coalizione inaccettabile e pericolosa
italian signor presidente ho avuto l onore di rappresentare il parlamento europeo nel consiglio di amministrazione dell osservatorio europeo contro il razzismo e la xenofobia e di avere come collega il professor anton pelinka rappresentante del governo austriaco
italian egli ha svolto un ruolo importante nelle deliberazioni di quell organo consigliando alla moderazione quando altri premevano per assumere posizioni pi forti o pi avanzate e respingendo le facili caratterizzazioni di bassa lega di coloro su cui stavamo indagando e ai quali opponevamo fatti e non fantasie
italian tutto sommato egli stato un amico assai poco conciliante per quanti fra noi volevano agire con maggiore velocit e con pi decisione
italian mi ha lasciato stupefatto perci assistere alla persecuzione di stato messa in atto contro il professor pelinka in primo luogo dall avvocato del signor haider il quale ha agito da accusatore e giudice nella causa di diffamazione contro il signor haider colpevole secondo il professore di aver reso politicamente accettabili posizioni e affermazioni di stampo nazionalsocialista
italian in secondo luogo da parte di alcuni settori dell attuale governo austriaco che con una serie di attacchi a livello amministrativo gli hanno implicitamente tolta la posizione di vicepresidente del consiglio di amministrazione dell osservatorio europeo contro il razzismo e la xenofobia
italian la risoluzione al nostro esame come auspicato luned dall onorevole watson chiede alla commissione per le libert e i diritti dei cittadini di seguire con attenzione gli sviluppi del caso
italian quanto accaduto non pu io credo sorprendere
italian nel quando il professor pelinka aveva richiamato il passato nazista di hans steinecker un predecessore del partito liberale il signor haider cos si era espresso riguardo al professore e finito il tempo dei falsificatori della storia e di coloro che insultano l austria
italian pelinka ha un rapporto psicologicamente patologico con la carinzia e il suo modo di propagare in continuazione falsit inaccettabile
italian nel marzo di quest anno il partito liberale ha affermato i giornali ancora una volta hanno avuto ragione
italian ora egli haider per noi un pericolo
italian ma haider non una minaccia per nessuno e l intera vicenda non poi cos incomprensibile
italian se nutro un cane e questi mi morde preferisco non farlo pi per non rischiare di farmi mordere di nuovo
italian nei prossimi sei mesi le persone di buon senso dovranno affrontare un compito impegnativo
italian signor presidente signor commissario desidero innanzi tutto respingere con fermezza l osservazione dell onorevole sylla secondo cui nel nostro paese la repubblica austriaca ci sarebbe una giustizia politica
italian in secondo luogo desidero far notare che vi sono parecchi temi di attualit che meriterebbero di essere trattati in seno al parlamento
italian il tema dell osservatorio europeo contro il razzismo e la xenofobia con sede a vienna idea proposta dall onorevole swoboda non merita un interrogazione urgente perche la motivazione in effetti una questione squisitamente personale che riguarda il professor pelinka
italian le sue dimissioni dal consiglio di amministrazione dell osservatorio sono state volontarie
italian il vero motivo va ricercato nel suo rifiuto di compiere un atto dovuto che compete a qualsiasi cittadino austriaco e che consiste nel render conto dell attivit svolta quando per tale attivit si viene remunerati dalla repubblica austriaca
italian che cosa c entri il parlamento europeo in tutto questo rimane un interrogativo senza risposta
italian e pertanto evidente che ci rifiutiamo di votare a favore del considerando a della proposta di risoluzione essendo per noi impossibile condividere le preoccupazioni espresse su questo caso
italian va inoltre ricordato che l osservatorio contro il razzismo ha sede a vienna anche grazie all impegno dell attuale cancelliere ed allora ministro degli esteri wolfgang schussel siamo orgogliosi di ospitare a vienna tale istituzione che mantiene uno sguardo vigile sui fenomeni della xenofobia e del razzismo in tutti i paesi europei perche come si deduce dalla relazione nessun paese al riparo da tali tendenze
italian in austria ci sono inoltre delle normative assai severe sul neonazismo e sul reiterarsi di tali fenomeni
italian a questo punto andrebbe forse ricordato che un triste caso il caso di omufuma ebbe luogo sotto la responsabilit di un ministro degli interni socialista
italian evidentemente anche l onorevole swoboda era cosciente della pochezza della sua proposta originaria altrimenti non si sarebbe giunti ad una proposta di risoluzione ragionevole ed edulcorata nei suoi punti essenziali che pu essere appoggiata da tutti
italian applausi
italian signor presidente non ho alcuna intenzione di approfondire le polemiche di bassa lega in particolare quella innescata dall onorevole pirker e desidero invece mantenere la discussione ad un certo livello ed attenermi ai fatti
italian il fatto che l osservatorio contro il razzismo e la xenofobia nelle prime settimane di attivit ha incontrato delle difficolt di natura politica e che in particolare il collega pirker ha insultato rozzamente la direttrice che oggi invece ha presentato come testimone del buon andamento delle cose in seno all osservatorio
italian il fatto ch ed ho ricordato anche nel mio primo intervento odierno che i parlamentari che ora si profondono in lodi non erano qui luned grazie a dio le cose sono migliorate perche la dottoressa winkler direttrice dell osservatorio si impegnata accanto al nuovo rappresentante del governo austriaco a riportare le cose in equilibrio
italian e c un altro fatto cio che la situazione continua ad essere precaria su questo punto sostengo come la dottoressa winkler che non soltanto il governo austriaco ma anche altri governi non forniscono sufficiente appoggio all osservatorio
italian vi quindi l urgenza di chiedere a tutti i govern come da me propost di sostenere l osservatorio
italian a ci si aggiunge un altro fatto ovvero che purtroppo l annunciato referendum in austria contro il quale si sono espressi alcuni giorni fa i rappresentanti del partito popolare europeo ed in particolare del partito popolare austriaco appartenenti a questo parlamento potrebbe acuire la situazione ed esacerbare gli animi in austria risvegliando sentimenti antieuropei che non gioverebbe certo all operato dell osservatorio
italian pertanto desidero esprimere la mia opinione in questa sede e lanciare un appello al governo ai responsabili del governo austriaco affinche prendano le distanze dal referendum e non fomentino nuovo odio non fomentino un nuovo sentire antieuropeo che non pu essere gradito ad un partito che come il partito popolare austriaco sempre stato europeista
italian mi oppongo con decisione a tale clima e ripongo la mia speranza in questo parlamento
italian signor presidente premetto che il gruppo eldr ha rifiutato di sottoscrivere la risoluzione comune per un semplice motivo ci sembra un po troppo emotiva le manca il rigore necessario e non offre la possibilit di una risposta pi politica e pi equilibrata da parte del parlamento
italian non voteremo la risoluzione perche troppo debole
italian riteniamo che il problema connesso alle dimissioni del professor pelinka sia sufficientemente importante per non essere affrontato con una risoluzione che lascia spazio alle passioni che non dice niente di preciso ed molto blanda
italian consentitemi di rivolgere un osservazione al gruppo confederale della sinistra europea e al gruppo del partito del socialismo europeo
italian non capisco il loro assenso sul testo presentato molto diverso dalla versione iniziale che questi due gruppi avevano proposto
italian noi del gruppo liberale auspichiam ed l auspicio dell onorevole watso che la sua commissione sia interpellata effettivamente su questo tema e che venga accertato in modo inequivocabile se il governo austriaco ha infranto l articolo del trattato non adempiendo i propri obblighi nei confronti dell osservatorio
italian se esso venuto meno ai suoi obblighi spetta al parlamento prendere dei provvedimenti di fronte alla commissione e al consiglio
italian il punto saperlo con certezza e al momento non lo sappiamo
italian signor presidente anche il mio gruppo appoggia la proposta del presidente della commissione per le libert e i diritti dei cittadini la giustizia e gli affari interni di trattare tutta la questione con grande attenzione in seno a questa commissione
italian ci nonostante votiamo a favore della risoluzione perche rispetto alle prime bozze essa rappresenta una reazione moderata e responsabile alle dichiarazioni fatte dalla direttrice dell osservatorio dinanzi alla commissione per gli affari interni
italian il partito popolare europeo ha partecipato alle trattative ed alla definizione dell attuale testo della risoluzione
italian mi sorprende quindi moltissimo che i parlamentari del partito popolare austriaco non possano votare a favore della risoluzione che esprime unicamente una prima preoccupazione un primo invito al governo austriaco e che ci diano invece un assaggio dell atteggiamento che il governo austriaco riserva a chi lo critica
italian l onorevole pirker ha dato lettura delle affermazioni della direttrice dell osservatorio tacendo le dichiarazioni pi sconvolgenti sulla diffamazione dell osservatorio in parlamento sugli abusi di potere sull assenza di disposizioni in materia di sicurezza sulla mancanza di appoggi che la direttrice aveva invece esternato in seno alla commissione dove era stata pi volte aggredita con veemenza dallo stesso onorevole
italian mi rincresce che i deputati del partito polare austriaco ci diano una dimostrazione di come vengono trattati i detrattori del governo nel loro paese ossia alla stregua di traditori della patria
italian se avete udito le dichiarazioni dell onorevole pirker in cui egli afferma che i critici del governo si rivoltano contro l austria non potete che considerarlo come un miserabile tentativo di generare artificialmente un conflitto tra la difesa dei diritti umani e il patriottismo
italian una pratica spregevole
italian signor presidente onorevoli colleghi stiamo discutendo su una proposta di risoluzione che priva di sostanza
italian non chiaro quali siano esattamente i punti in discussione stiamo cio discutendo di qualcosa il cui contenuto non chiaro
italian chi conosce veramente la lettera di dimissioni del professor pelinka
italian chi conosce le vere circostanze in cui hanno avuto luogo le dimissioni
italian ci che si sa delle dimissioni del professor pelinka in austria che al riguardo si intrecciano versioni diverse provenienti da pi parti
italian ci che so per certo che ancora in corso un procedimento giudiziario tra l onorevole haider e il professor pelinka
italian non spetta comunque al mondo politico ne ad un qualsiasi parlamento criticare un procedimento giudiziario ancora in corso presso un tribunale indipendente
italian in ogni stato di diritto ci sono strumenti giuridici costituzionali
italian un mondo politico che non rispetta l indipendenza della giustizia non rispetta il principio cardine della divisione dei poteri e di conseguenza viola uno dei principi cardine della democrazia
italian il razzismo e la xenofobia sono un grave problema in tutta l unione europea e vanno presi seriamente
italian laddove il fenomeno si manifesta va combattuto con tutti i mezzi possibili
italian ci che mi attendo dall osservatorio una constatazione obiettiva dei fatti ed un analisi comparativa che metta il mondo politico in condizioni di reagire
italian ci che invece non mi aspetto dall osservatorio che si intrometta in questioni di politica quotidiana e che eserciti il proprio mandato seguendo un ideologia perche dietro i concetti di razzismo e di xenofobia si celano persone ed i loro destini che mal si adattano ad essere sfruttati per una messa in scena politica
italian ci che non posso accettare che questa proposta di risoluzione indifferenziata giunga anche da quei deputati austriaci che dicono di impegnarsi per la loro patria
italian signor presidente la commissione grata per il contributo prezioso che il professor pelinka ha fornito in qualit di membro del consiglio di amministrazione all istituzione di un osservatorio europeo contro il razzismo e la xenofobia
italian rientra tra le procedure abituali della commissione non esprimere alcun parere su procedimenti giuridici che interessino singole persone nei paesi membri
italian ci vale in modo particolare per questo caso che non rientra nel campo di applicazione del diritto comunitario
italian inoltre la commissione non si pu esprimere sui motivi che hanno indotto il professor pelinka a presentare le dimissioni dal consiglio di amministrazione dell osservatorio
italian i servizi della commissione hanno gi invitato le autorit austriache a nominare un nuovo membro all interno del consiglio di amministrazione
italian la commissione ribadisce l importanza dell indipendenza dei membri del consiglio di amministrazione come stabilito nel regolamento che istituisce l osservatorio
italian non vedo la necessit di ulteriori rassicurazioni da parte nostra essendo noto a tutti che la commissione ha sostenuto l osservatorio a vienna con tutti i mezzi a sua disposizione e che lo far anche in futuro
italian siamo profondamente convinti che l osservatorio svolga una funzione importante nella lotta contro il razzismo la xenofobia e l antisemitismo
italian desidero ricordare ancora una volta ed in modo esplicito che per la commissione di fondamentale importanza che in qualsiasi circostanza si preservi il carattere dell osservatorio inteso come istituzione indipendente che gode della massima autonomia nell esercizio delle proprie funzioni
italian la discussione sui problemi di attualit urgenti e di notevole rilevanza chiusa
italian passiamo ora alla votazione
italian prima della votazione sui bambini soldato in uganda
italian signor presidente abbiamo concertato una proposta di risoluzione alla quale hanno collaborato cinque gruppi
italian a documento ultimato un sesto gruppo si associato alla risoluzione
italian ritengo che sia contrario al regolamento che un nuovo gruppo aderisca ad una proposta senza prima aver interpellato gli altri
italian il mio gruppo lo considera una violazione del regolamento e le chiedo pertanto signor presidente di verificare la situazione
italian avendo partecipato alla stesura della proposta di risoluzione voteremo a favore la invito a far s che la firma del sesto gruppo venga cancellata dalla presente proposta
italian la questione gi stata affrontata e per quanto di nostra conoscenza non vi alcuna norma che impedisca di firmare un altra risoluzione
italian la firma perci pu restare al suo posto
italian tuttavia suggerisco di approfondire la questione a beneficio di casi futuri
italian prima della votazione sul venezuela
italian signor presidente si tratta della medesima situazione che ho delineato prima
italian insisto nel richiedere una verifica della situazione perche proprio durante le sedute di questa settimana un nostro collega voleva sottoscrivere la proposta di risoluzione presentata da altri gruppi ed ha dovuto fornire l autorizzazione scritta di questi ultimi
italian non possono essere applicate due procedure diverse nella stessa settimana
italian la prego pertanto di effettuare tale verifica e di comunicarcene i risultati
italian appoggiamo questa proposta che ci ha visto partecipi nella stesura
italian comprendo perfettamente quanto lei sta dicendo
italian studieremo la questione ma al momento non sembra esserci alcuna norma al riguardo
italian signor presidente come lei ha ricordato all inizio della sessione l onorevole sakellariou ci ha deliziato con quattro richieste di modifica dell ordine del giorno che sono state tutte respinte ed ora vuole concludere la sessione con un altra richiesta che come lei ha gi dichiarato del tutto irricevibile
italian possiamo continuare in questo modo ma perderemmo tempo
italian il presidente ha gi risposto e mi pare che abbia assolutamente ragione
italian non intendo avviare un ulteriore discussione sull argomento
italian la presidenza provveder certamente ad approfondire la questione
italian votazioni
italian signor presidente intervengo per una questione di procedura
italian considerando la discussione con il consiglio avvenuta ieri sera mi chiedo se la relazione in questione sia in effetti abbastanza coerente con la proposta originale tanto da consentirci di procedere in prima lettura
italian su un certo numero di emendamenti certamente necessario avere ulteriori chiarimenti e mi pare che mettendo ora in votazione tali emendamenti l esito della relazione contrasterebbe con ci su cui quest aula legittimata a votare
italian mi riferisco in particolare agli emendamenti nn e alcuni dei quali implicano direttamente un azione politica a livello delle singole scuole negli stati membri
italian vorrei quindi sapere se da un punto di vista procedurale sia corretto che l aula effettui la votazione in questo momento
italian tutti gli emendamenti sono stati esaminati e considerati ricevibili dai servizi competenti e perci la votazione su di essi avr luogo adesso

italian signor presidente intervengo solo per fare una precisazione in merito alle informazioni comunicate a questa assemblea alcuni minuti fa
italian in effetti l incidente accaduto in spagna molto grave
italian il numero di bambini che vi hanno perso la vita e le loro famiglie alle quali desideriamo porgere le nostre pi sentite condoglianze sono di cerdanyola del valles e di viladecans a barcellona
italian provveder ad accertare che la presidente sia pienamente informata dei fatti e che si faccia quanto da lei richiesto
italian signor presidente non sono al corrente della gravit dei fatti ma se alcuni bambini sono morti vorrei proporre all assemblea di osservare un minuto di silenzio
italian e necessario disporre di maggiori informazioni sulla gravit della tragedia
italian dichiarazioni di voto relazione redondo jimenez a
italian signor presidente ho votato a favore della relazione redondo che regolamenta l intervento dell unione europea in caso di incendi e di inquinamento atmosferico
italian certamente un provvedimento positivo
italian ho votato a favore ma gradirei che in futuro si tenesse conto nell applicazione di questa proposta che presso le foreste vivono molti anziani e pensionati che sono a volte gli unici rimasti nelle campagne e nelle zone isolate nelle quali di frequente si verificano degli incendi
italian sarebbe bene quindi anzi opportuno utilizzare queste persone nella lotta contro gli incendi
italian nella presente relazione sono previste modifiche agli attuali regolamenti sulla protezione delle foreste della comunit contro l inquinamento atmosferico e gli incendi
italian per il portogallo hanno particolare importanza le modifiche al regolamento relativo alla lotta contro gli incendi forestali
italian in realt necessario attribuire sempre maggior attenzione alla macchia mediterranea in quanto colpita da incendi forestali e quindi necessaria una grande disponibilit di mezzi finanziari per procedere al rimboschimento e per attuare le opportune misure di prevenzione degli incendi
italian per il portogallo dove gli incendi hanno distrutto importanti zone forestali fondamentale aumentare gli stanziamenti onde integrare gli investimenti nazionali includendo la costruzione di infrastrutture e l acquisizione di attrezzature fra le attivit da svolgere ai fini della prevenzione degli incendi sia attraverso le autonomie amministrative sia attraverso associazioni di proprietari privati o organi di gestione dei terreni incolti
italian di conseguenza devono essere sempre pi considerevoli le dotazioni comunitarie che la relatrice propone di aumentare fino a milioni di euro in luogo dei milioni previsti nella proposta della commissione
italian e importante inoltre creare un sistema comunitario di informazione sugli incendi forestali che permetta una conoscenza pi approfondita della situazione attuale in modo da permettere una lotta pi efficace contro gli incendi forestali e le loro cause
italian vorrei esprimermi a titolo personale sulla relazione a proposito delle foreste
italian so che la commissione per l agricoltura sostiene che sbagliamo discussione quando chiediamo un aumento degli stanziamenti nel quadro di questa relazione
italian da parte mia ritengo che abbiamo la responsabilit politica di inviare segnali politici forti alla commissione al consiglio e ai cittadini
italian nel dicembre una parte dell unione europea stata devastata da terribili tempeste che hanno distrutto gran parte delle foreste della francia meridionale e orientale e indotto alla disperazione le vittime dei disastri in particolare i piccoli proprietari
italian so anche che non si veste pietro togliendo i vestiti a paolo
italian votando a favore delle proposte del relatore ho voluto contribuire alla messa in opera di una vera politica forestale dell unione nonostante il bilancio colossale della pac il patrimonio forestale che rientra nella politica agricola continua ad essere trascurato
italian sono in esame due regolamenti del consiglio che istituiscono un sistema unico al mondo di sorveglianza sistematica degli ecosistemi forestali
italian il regolamento n concerne la protezione delle foreste dall inquinamento atmosferico mentre il regolamento n
italian definisce un quadro nella lotta contro gli incendi delle foreste il relatore propone di aumentare gli stanziamenti destinati a questi due programmi mentre la commissione vuole ridurli drasticamente
italian l approccio del relatore quello giusto
italian sarebbe logico tenere in conto che dal data dell ultimo ampliament la superficie boschiva della comunit quasi raddoppiata nonche agire in conformit delle esigenze della strategia forestale dell unione europea
italian certo nel trattato non c una base giuridica che autorizzi una politica forestale comune
italian non si tratta di servirsi della relazione per rilanciare il dibattito bens di ricordare che la strategia forestale europea si basa sulla sussidiariet
italian in altri termini un azione viene proposta solo se essa presenta un valore aggiunto rispetto ad un azione a livello nazionale
italian il punto di sapere quando c un valore aggiunto
italian in questo ambito preciso la sussidiariet gioca a favore di un azione comunitaria
italian e vero che i problemi non si pongono negli stessi termini per le foreste dei quindici
italian ad esempio i paesi nordici che hanno fornito il grosso del capitale boschivo al momento dell ampliamento del sono sensibili all inquinamento atmosferico all incidenza dei cambiamenti climatici e all acidificazione del suolo mentre gli stati dell europa meridionale sono pi esposti agli effetti della desertificazione della siccit e degli incendi
italian ma le differenze non devono far dubitare della necessit di un dispositivo di sorveglianza gestito a livello comunitario tanto pi che l interdipendenza dei fattori di stress che colpiscono gli ecosistemi forestali universalmente riconosciuta
italian l aumento degli stanziamenti giunge al momento opportuno a seguito delle spaventose tempeste del dicembre scorso i nostri massicci boschivi sono esposti al pericolo di incendi e in queste zone infatti sono stati recensiti numerosi casi d incendio
italian la prevenzione di catastrofi come queste presuppone un miglioramento della sicurezza per i casi d incendio
italian considerato che la commissione nella sua comunicazione del febbraio auspica il ricorso generalizzato al principio della precauzione e che un programma d azione comunitario a favore della protezione civile istituito da una decisione del consiglio del dicembre aspetta solo di essere utilizzato non opportuno amputare finanziariamente il regolamento n
italian per quanto riguarda l inquinamento atmosferico esso sta acquisendo una nuova dimensione alla luce degli orientamenti che la commissione si prefissata in materia di cambiamenti climatici di biodiversit e di gestione duratura
italian la sorveglianza degli ecosistemi si prospetta come un ambito multidisciplinare
italian se l inquinamento atmosferico ha perso la sua attualit scottante rispetto a queste nuove priorit esso si integra in modo coerente nelle sfide planetarie
italian il merito del problema resta in ogni caso politico
italian sono stati avanzati alcuni dubbi a proposito dell importanza delle foreste per gli stati membri quando l industria forestale in europa d lavoro a due milioni duecentomila persone e le foreste ricoprono il percento della superficie dell unione
italian
italian e come un cane che si morde la coda i regolamenti in esame necessitano di un sostegno politico ma perche tale sostegno venga loro accordato necessario che le reti di sorveglianza siano in grado di individuare i cambiamenti e i rischi un sostegno finanziario necessario per provare scientificamente l esistenza di tali rischi
italian in attesa dell estensione dei programmi oltre il fa parte delle nostre responsabilit politiche sostenerli finanziariamente
italian i dati raccolti dovrebbero infatti servire come supporto tecnico alle decisioni politiche in ambiti in cui vige il principio senza evidenza nessun intervento
italian le foreste sono estremamente importanti ai fini del mantenimento di fondamentali equilibri ecologici nell ecosistema del pianeta ma purtroppo non possono contare su una tutela e un attenzione proporzionate
italian le immani catastrofi che hanno colpito le foreste negli ultimi anni e le carenze nell azione di contenimento mettono a repentaglio sia l equilibrio ecologico sia la salute la sicurezza e i valori sociali e culturali indissolubilmente legati al patrimonio forestale
italian negli ultimi anni le regioni montane e boschive specie quelle del bacino del mediterraneo hanno gravemente sofferto a causa del disboscamento degli incendi della desertificazione dell abbandono dello sfruttamento abusivo e di un rimboschimento insufficiente con la conseguente perdita di decine di migliaia di ettari di preziose superfici boschive
italian vorrei proporvi l esempio drammatico della grecia che vanta il triste primato europeo di superfici bruciate
italian solo il percento delle aree andate distrutte in grecia viene rimboscato il restante percento viene abbandonato o nella maggior parte dei casi viene sfruttato per costruirvi abusivamente ad esempio imprese turistiche di norma favorite dal governo di turno da chi ha l interesse economico e sa approfittare degli incendi o ne direttamente responsabile dell irrisolto problema della propriet della mancanza di un catasto forestale e della mancata registrazione del patrimonio forestale dello stato al fine di massimizzare i propri profitti
italian e un fatto che nell unione esistono una grande variet di foreste boreale temperata mediterranea e tropicale e altrettanta variet di problemi e peculiarit
italian sinora la politica forestale dell ue con le sue azioni frammentarie congiunturali incongruenti e limitate e con fondi insufficienti a disposizione non solo non riuscita ad affrontare alla radice i problemi ma si scontra ora anche con le decisioni della commissione che propone di ridurre ulteriormente i gi scarsi fondi per la tutela delle foreste dagli incendi e dall inquinamento atmosferico
italian la motivazione dei tagli proposti un minore assorbimento degli stanziamenti nel periodo precedente
italian i problemi non sono stati risolti ma anzi si sono aggravati
italian una simile politica tipica non di un ipocrita ma di un complice o di un incendiario
italian persistiamo quindi nelle nostre posizioni
italian esortiamo il parlamento a ricordare le ripetute risoluzioni e le prese di posizione circa la necessit di rafforzare le misure di prevenzione e di lotta agli incendi nonche di tutela e valorizzazione del patrimonio forestale in tutte le regioni dell unione
italian riteniamo che le risorse finanziarie dell ue destinate alle foreste siano state e continuino ad essere inadeguate e quindi chiediamo un loro incremento per soddisfare il fabbisogno reale e per tener conto dell importanza delle foreste
italian e necessario intraprendere in collaborazione con le autorit e gli organismi competenti nazionali e locali le opportune iniziative per elaborare un efficace politica forestale e attuare un azione immediata e coordinata allo scopo di rilanciare e rimboschire le aree boschive andate distrutte rispettando le condizioni climatiche ed ecologiche di ciascuna regione e tenendo conto dei pi moderni dati e metodi scientifici a disposizione occorre ribadire che imprescindibile che l unione e i vari governi mettano a disposizione fondi per la creazione delle necessarie infrastrutture e per l assunzione di personale adeguato dato che quello attuale a giudicare dalla situazione in grecia assolutamente insufficiente
italian in tal modo potremo contribuire alla tutela allo sviluppo al riassetto ecologico e alla valorizzazione produttiva delle foreste in detti paesi
italian signor presidente mi sono astenuto nella votazione sulla relazione arvidsson sulla proibizione dell uso degli ftalati
italian mi sono astenuto come tutto il gruppo del partito popolare europeo ma la mia stata un astensione ulteriormente dubbiosa dubbiosa perche poco prima di venire in aula per la votazione mi sono chiesto visto che proibiamo l uso di una sostanza gli ftalati non ovunque e sempre nel nostro territorio ma soltanto allorquando si usano gli ftalati nei giocattoli per bambini che succeder alle ditte che producono gli ftalati
italian non succeder che magari utilizzeranno questi ftalati per altri scopi
italian forse per oggetti che possono essere di uso degli anziani e dei pensionati
italian o forse di altro uso
italian questo mi preoccuperebbe molto
italian non voglio continuare signor presidente perche non siamo a porte chiuse quindi preferisco fermarmi qui
italian ove venga adottato l emendamento n all articolo della direttiva vale la seguente dichiarazione di voto del gruppo ppe de del parlamento europeo
italian i deputati del gruppo ppe de hanno scelto di astenersi dal voto sul progetto di risoluzione legislativa in quanto stato adottato l emendamento n all articolo della direttiva
italian la causa l avvertenza riportata su giocattoli e articoli per l infanzia prodotto integralmente o parzialmente in pvc morbido contenente ftalati e sulle loro confezioni destinati a bambini fra i e i anni d et molto difficile da gestire e rischia di rivelarsi in realt una sorta di indiretto divieto generalizzato
italian il contenuto di questa decisione presa sull etichettatura va pertanto al di l del fondamento scientifico su cui si regge la direttiva
italian il dossier sulla sicurezza dei giocattoli mi sta particolarmente a cuore
italian sono stato relatore su questo tema nel e seguo con la massima attenzione gli sviluppi legislativi in tale materia
italian per quanto riguarda gli ftalati sostanze chimiche utilizzate per rendere il pvc pi morbido mi sono sempre battuto a favore di misure efficaci per tutelare nel modo migliore quel gruppo di consumatori particolarmente vulnerabili costituito dai bambini
italian sperimentazioni sugli animali hanno dimostrato la tossicit e il carattere cancerogeno di taluni ftalati tali sostanze possono infatti provocare malattie al fegato ai reni e ai testicoli in bambini che succhiano o mordicchiano ciucci dentaroli o giocattoli
italian l elenco dei rischi ha suscitato la legittima inquietudine dei genitori e questo avrebbe dovuto portare all adozione di misure decise dettate dal principio della precauzione
italian ora il meno che si possa dire che la reazione della commissione sebbene sia stata relativamente rapida richiesta di parere al comitato scientifico studi di tossicit di ecotossicit e di effetti sull ambiente decisione di divieto d urgenza e proposta di modifica delle direttive interessate stata insufficiente rispetto alla posta in gioco e all obiettivo di garantire un livello elevato di protezione dei consumatori e della salute umana
italian cosa ci ha proposto la commissione europea
italian ci ha proposto di vietare i giocattoli contenenti uno dei sei ftalati incriminati destinati a essere introdotti in bocca dai bambini di et inferiore ai tre anni e di rivedere la direttiva tra quattro anni
italian ovviamente questi provvedimenti sono del tutto insufficienti
italian e assurdo prevedere un divieto solo per i giocattoli o gli oggetti destinati ad essere introdotti in bocca
italian infatti come i genitori sanno i bambini piccoli mettono tutto in bocca
italian e necessario dunque vietare i giocattoli e gli oggetti che contengono ftalati che potrebbero essere totalmente o parzialmente messi in bocca
italian la mancanza d informazioni scientifiche affidabili sulla migrazione di tali sostanze chimiche nell organismo deve indurci ad applicare il principio della precauzione
italian vorrei sottolineare che sar necessario controllare con grande attenzione le sostanze impiegate per sostituire gli ftalati
italian e indispensabile rendere obbligatoria l etichettatura dei giocattoli e degli articoli per l infanzia che contengono ftalati e che potrebbero essere messi in bocca
italian per evitare di incitare i bambini a mordere o succhiare i loro giocattoli dovrebbe essere aggiunta una disposizione supplementare che preveda il divieto di utilizzare sostanze aromatiche
italian occorre prevedere una revisione della direttiva in modo da aggiornarla in funzione dei progressi delle conoscenze scientifiche
italian sono convinto che allo stato attuale delle nostre informazioni dobbiamo dare prova della massima prudenza
italian ho sostenuto gli emendamenti presentati dai deputati socialisti della commissione per l ambiente
italian concludo ricordando che per quanto riguarda il dossier sulla sicurezza dei giocattoli le norme in materia di marchi ce sono troppo ambigue e dovrebbero rapidamente essere chiarite
italian fi non si potuta dimostrare scientificamente la tossicit degli ftalati per la salute umana
italian negli stati uniti ad esempio la ricerca effettuata dalla u s consumer product safety commission ha stabilito che ben rar posto che accad che un bambino possa correre il rischio di essere esposto a sostanze chimiche nocive dato che la quantit di ftalati presenti nei giocattoli non supera il livello di tossicit
italian data l esigua quantit di ftalati che potrebbero passare dai giocattoli all organismo del bambino i ricercatori non si pronunziano a favore del divieto degli ftalati
italian personalmente non incoraggio gli eccessi di protezione allarmistica e il divieto portato all estremo che non sia fondato su dati scientifici
italian gli ftalati hanno scarsi effetti tossici immediati e non irritano ne le mucose ne la pelle
italian nonostante negli anni ottanta sia stato dimostrato che ingenti dosi di ftalati causano ai ratti e ai topi neoformazioni tumorali al fegato le fonti ufficiali in europa e negli stati uniti non hanno confermato il pericolo che gli ftalati provochino tumori nell uomo
italian inoltre aborrisco il pensiero che gli ftalati siano sostituiti da sostanze di cui non si conoscono gli effetti
italian sono comunque a favore della conduzione di ulteriori ricerche su quegli ftalati dei cui effetti non si pu essere certi
italian dal punto di vista pratico tuttavia il problema di poco conto giacche l industria europea dei giocattoli ha per la maggior parte abbandonato l uso degli ftalati
italian relazione hieronymi a
italian signor presidente sulla relazione media ho votato a favore ma credo che essendo gli anziani e i pensionati quelli che seguono pi di frequente le nostre televisioni e che quindi sono molto interessati a questi aiuti dell unione europea sarebbe bene che potessero vedere una televisione europea dei programmi europei che vanno in onda su una televisione europea
italian credo che si riuscirebbe maggiormente a mantenere la cultura delle nostre nazioni conosciuta in europa anziche importare solamente filmati di altri stati tra cui soprattutto gli stati uniti d america
italian mi auguro quindi che nell attuare questo documento si abbia riguardo a questa mia proposta
italian i cristiano democratici svedesi avanzano obiezioni di fondo in base al principio di sussidiariet sancito dai trattati di maastricht e di amsterdam contro l idea che fondi dell ue possano essere impiegati per lo sviluppo la produzione e la commercializzazione di ci che si definisce film europeo e per la formazione cinematografica
italian questi fondi sarebbero ben pi necessari alla ricostruzione in kosovo un intervento di assistenza europea che non ha ancora trovato una soluzione sul piano finanziario dopo un anno di scontri sul bilancio all interno dell unione
italian l intenzione di controbilanciare lo strapotere americano in ambito cinematografico e culturale comprensibile e lodevole ma si tratta di un compito che spetta all industria cinematografica privata e agli stati membri stessi
italian l unione europea deve piuttosto pensare a fare piazza pulita di tutti i compiti che non hanno a che vedere con le sue finalit principali
italian signor presidente per quanto concerne le relazioni seguite da discussione vorrei che lei pregasse gli onorevoli colleghi di presentare le proprie dichiarazioni di voto per iscritto o almeno di rimanere in aula sino alla fine per esprimerle oralmente cos come hanno diritto di fare
italian per ciascuno di noi a quest ora la dichiarazione di voto per iscritto rappresenta una questione di rispetto nei confronti dell assemblea
italian prendiamo nota della sua osservazione onorevole mastorakis
italian relazione sanders ten holte a
italian ci siamo astenute dalla votazione su questo progetto sebbene siamo persuase che una politica di scambi e di cooperazione tra i diversi paesi nell ambito dell insegnamento contribuirebbe a migliorarne la qualit favorendo l incontro tra le culture e gli scambi tra i popoli che vivono in europa
italian tuttavia un tale orientamento sar un fattore di progresso solo se sar basato su una politica dell educazione dei diversi stati che miri ad accordare maggiori mezzi all insegnamento pubblico accessibile a tutti
italian tale priorit non figura nei testi ma soprattutto non applicata in alcuno degli stati dell unione europea
italian ci preoccupa il fatto che diverse affermazioni esprimano una concezione limitata e utilitaristica di una cooperazione i cui obiettivi sarebbero dettati dalle esigenze del mercato e dalle iniziative di imprese o di organismi privati a caccia di mano d opera che intendono formare e qualificare in funzione dei loro bisogni
italian introdurre le leggi del mercato nell educazione vuol dire renderla peggiore per la maggioranza e riservare la qualit a una minoranza
italian per questo motivo abbiamo votato a favore degli emendamenti che mettono in guardia contro un ruolo troppo importante del mercato nell educazione
italian e noto che la definizione della qualit dell insegnamento una questione politica molto complessa dato che dipende in particolare dagli obiettivi predefiniti dai mezzi a disposizione per conseguirli e dalle condizioni che caratterizzano la sua realizzazione
italian di conseguenza la cooperazione a livello europeo sulla valutazione della qualit e sugli indicatori di qualit non deve servire a produrre modelli di valutazione dato che essenziale mantenere la diversit dei metodi e degli approcci tenendo presenti i diversi contesti nazionali la situazione storica sociale culturale e politica di ogni paese
italian la cooperazione possibile fatta in base allo scambio di esperienze sulla valutazione della qualit dell insegnamento elementare e secondario deve pertanto tener conto del fatto che riguarda un settore particolarmente sensibile che deve rispettare integralmente la responsabilit degli stati membri circa il contenuto dell insegnamento e l organizzazione dei sistemi di educazione e formazione unitamente alla diversit culturale e linguistica
italian relazione mombaur a
italian signor presidente ho votato a favore anche perch in un considerando scritto che la concorrenza non impedisce agli stati di imporre obblighi di servizio pubblico nell interesse generale
italian vorrei auspicare che nell attuazione di questo considerando si stabilisca che per quanto riguarda le forniture di gas ad uso domestico si tenga conto che tante persone non hanno reddit e tra questi i pensionati che non hanno abbastanza per viver per cui dovrebbe essere prescritta una franchigia per utilizzare una certa quantit di gas o di energia di altro tipo fornita gratuitamente
italian questa relazione nel merito e in ciascuna delle sue affermazioni un panegirico della concorrenza e dell economia di mercato
italian l unica preoccupazione del suo autore con il pretesto di unificare i mercati dell energia in europa quella di affidare l intero settore nelle mani dei privati
italian pi esattamente separando la produzione dell elettricit dalla gestione delle reti di distribuzione il relatore concede agli stati di occuparsi delle attivit che richiedono enormi investimenti e sono poco redditizie a condizione che essi lascino ai privati le attivit pi redditizie
italian l unificazione della produzione e della distribuzione dell energia di tutta l unione europea e la pianificazione e razionalizzazione di questi due aspetti potrebbero rappresentare un progresso se l insieme continuasse ad essere un servizio pubblico esclusivamente volto al soddisfacimento dei bisogni e non alla massimizzazione del profitto privato
italian l approccio del relatore esattamente antitetico
italian se il processo di liberalizzazione che egli auspica avesse luogo ci sarebbe una regressione di conseguenza abbiamo votato contro la relazione
italian come nuovo deputato di questo parlamento confesso di essere sgomento
italian non ho partecipato alla precedente legislatura durante la quale si assistito alla grande svendita del concetto di servizio pubblico alla francese parlo proprio di svendita come quella organizzata nei settori dei trasporti delle poste o delle telecomunicazioni
italian prefiggendosi di analizzare lo stato di applicazione delle direttive sull elettricit del dicembre e sul gas del giugno la relazione mombaur lascia chiaramente trasparire la filosofia ultraliberale della commissione la quale chiede col pretesto di realizzare il mercato interno dell energia a tutto vantaggio dei consumatori la totale apertura dei mercati alla piena concorrenza
italian il processo sempre lo stesso la commissione propone una direttiva minimalista argomentando che la liberalizzazione pu avere effetti positivi soltanto in un contesto di deregolamentazione
italian i sostenitori del sempre pi europa quindi recepiscono la direttiva spingendosi persino oltre ad inizio dell anno il percento del mercato europeo risultava liberalizzato mentre la direttiva imponeva soltanto un percento
italian e la commissione infine regolarizza successivamente una situazione di fatto in maniera ancora pi vincolante
italian un processo quindi tanto pi inaccettabile in quanto i problemi sono ancora irrisolti
italian perche realizzare un mercato unico dell energia quando elettricit e gas non sono comparabili in termini di produzione distribuzione di andamento del mercato di nozione di servizio pubblico
italian come chiedere ad un prestatore di un servizio pubblico di assicurare continuit ed equit quando tale esercizio non economicamente redditizio
italian e allo stesso tempo come chiedere ai vecchi monopoli di entrare oggi in un regime di piena concorrenza quando devono continuare ad ammortizzare pesanti investimenti che sono il frutto delle scelte politiche di un tempo
italian come pretendere prezzi sempre pi bassi in nome di una ormai insindacabile concorrenza senza rimettere in discussione le attuali esigenze di sicurezza nucleare
italian come sostituire il concetto nazionale di servizio pubblico con quello comunitario molto pi restrittivo di missione di interesse generale
italian potrei andare avanti cos per pagine e pagine
italian non dimenticate che ci sono voluti decenni di tradizione repubblicana per costruire un po alla volta i nostri servizi pubblici mentre quattro anni di periodo di recepimento basteranno per vanificarli completamente
italian non possiamo quindi votare a favore della presente relazione che esprime la volont dell onnipotente commissione di andare sempre oltre e sempre pi in fretta verso la liberalizzazione
italian il liberismo pu essere opportuno vero ma a condizione che venga gestito con gradualit moderazione e senza escludere definitivamente l intervento dello stato salvo rischiare un domani di subire le conseguenze finanziarie di una simile rinuncia
italian in seguito alle conclusioni del consiglio europeo di lisbona tenuto il e marzo di quest anno in cui si stabilito di accelerare la liberalizzazione in settori come quelli della fornitura di gas ed elettricit dei servizi postali e dei trasporti il commissario europeo per l energia ha presentato un insieme di misure volte ad accelerare la liberalizzazione nel settore dell elettricit includendo l applicazione di meccanismi di concertazione per superare eventuali impedimenti alla liberalizzazione e negoziare l accesso al mercato comunitario con paesi terzi
italian com noto al consiglio europeo di santa maria da feira la commissione era stata invitata a presentare una relazione sull evoluzione dei mercati dell energia fino al marzo nei termini della strategia di lisbona in modo da valutare i progressi compiuti nell ambito della liberalizzazione del mercato dell elettricit in occasione del consiglio di stoccolma del marzo
italian di conseguenza con l appoggio di vari governi e durante la presidenza portoghese sono stati rafforzati diversi meccanismi di pressione destinati ad accelerare il processo che era gi in corso con una direttiva sull elettricit risalente al dicembre che prevedeva l apertura a fasi del mercato da attuarsi in modo graduale fino al mentre la direttiva del relativa al gas naturale prevede l ultima fase di apertura di questo settore nel con gravi conseguenze per il portogallo soprattutto per l edp i suoi lavoratori e i consumatori portoghesi
italian in questo modo sono messi in secondo piano sia i problemi dell impiego dei lavoratori delle imprese del settore sia gli interessi di ogni stato membro compresa la difesa di un servizio pubblico di qualit che venga incontro agli interessi dei consumatori
italian a tutto ci noi siamo assolutamente contrari
italian scopo della presente relazione giustificare la liberalizzazione del settore non solo dell energia elettrica ma anche del gas naturale
italian in sostanza essa sottrae allo stato un settore produttivo d importanza strategica e ne consegna l intera attivit nelle mani del capitale privato affinche quest ultimo possa aumentare i propri profitti
italian lo stato relegato al ruolo di semplice coordinatore degli interessi monopolistici e di supervisore degli orientamenti stabiliti dall ue a scapito dell economia nazionale e degli interessi del popolo
italian la logica della relazione non certo dettata dall esigenza di rispettare gli interessi popolari cio del semplice cittadino o di sviluppare il paese bens dal soddisfacimento degli interessi dei grandi monopoli
italian la relazione contiene diverse imprecisioni nel tentativo di presentare nel modo migliore la liberalizzazione del settore energetico
italian ad esempio non vero che in gran bretagna la concorrenza abbia portato ad una riduzione dei prezzi e ad un incremento nel numero degli occupati
italian a quattro cinque anni dalla privatizzazione dell energia elettrica si sono registrati un forte aumento dei prezzi e una riduzione del personale ed stata sospesa l elaborazione di un programma nazionale di sviluppo a lungo termine nel settore dell energia elettrica
italian in un altro punto della stessa relazione si ammette che c stato un calo del numero degli occupati come conseguenza della liberalizzazione ma si prevede anche un aumento del numero di posti di lavoro in settori non produttivi in borsa nella pubblicit nelle societ di intermediazione finanziaria eccetera
italian secondo uno studio effettuato dalla societ pubblica per l elettricit dei in grecia la liberalizzazione dell energia elettrica comporter una riduzione del personale da a unit segnando anche la fine di molti servizi utili per la dei e per l economia nazionale come la promozione delle nuove tecnologie gli studi sulle centrali eccetera
italian la privatizzazione e la liberalizzazione causeranno un aumento dei prezzi particolarmente considerevole per gli utenti nelle piccole isole dell egeo che pagano i chilowattora ad un prezzo decisamente inferiore rispetto al costo effettivo
italian e inaccettabile che nel nome della presunta concorrenza un ente pubblico sia costretto a mettere a disposizione dei privati una rete di trasporto e distribuzione di enorme valore
italian se l unione europea volesse veramente una sana concorrenza secondo il suo modo di vedere dovrebbe obbligare i privati a costruire le proprie reti e unit produttive per mettersi in concorrenza con gli enti pubblici senza costringere invece gli enti pubblici ad offrire le proprie reti ai concorrenti
italian cos facendo vogliono semplicemente agevolare il trasferimento di ricchezze a favore del grande capitale
italian per questo motivo si tenta di separare i settori in modo da impedire all ente pubblico di puntare ad un risultato ottimale nelle sue attivit verticalizzate ed essere cos competitivo
italian la produzione di energia non un semplice bene di consumo in quanto questo settore particolarmente importante per lo sviluppo economico di un paese e vitale per la sua difesa
italian la liberalizzazione dei mercati dell energia mette quindi a repentaglio non solo la sicurezza ma anche lo sviluppo del paese
italian il pericolo tangibile visto che come si sottolinea nella relazione le imprese dei servizi pubblici devono operare sul mercato europeo nell europa senza frontiere tali imprese non sono pi strettamente nazionali come non lo sono nemmeno i loro azionisti
italian per queste considerazioni gli europarlamentari del gruppo gue ngl hanno votato contro la relazione mombaur
italian e positivo che gli sforzi volti alla creazione di un mercato dell energia liberalizzato sembrino ora dare frutti
italian la maggior parte dei paesi ormai in una fase avanzata della ristrutturazione del mercato
italian alcuni paesi hanno gi attuato una piena liberalizzazione e mi fa particolarmente piacere che la danimarca faccia parte del gruppo di testa
italian la danimarca deve sfruttare questa posizione favorevole e completare la liberalizzazione come gi avvenuto tra gli altri paesi in svezia
italian e perci deplorevole che il governo danese non preveda apparentemente per il momento di compiere l ultimo passo verso la piena liberalizzazione
italian l ottima relazione dell onorevole mombaur colpisce nel segno su molti punti
italian occorre in particolare segnalare che importante che si pensi sin d ora alla situazione dei paesi candidati
italian la liberalizzazione del mercato dell energia dei paesi dell europa orientale richieder misure particolari e occorre soprattutto tenere conto dell aspetto ambientale
italian e altres importante sottolineare che la produzione di energia elettrica deve essere trasparente e che un aiuto speciale non deve in alcun modo costituire una distorsione della concorrenza
italian relazione radwan a
italian signor presidente queste non sono dichiarazioni di voto ma una prosecuzione della discussione
italian non so ancora come abbia votato l onorevole berthu ne mi interessa saperlo ma questa non una dichiarazione di voto ma una continuazione della discussione
italian signor presidente ho votato a favore della relazione radwan nonostante al punto a pagina si chieda di accelerare le riforme strutturali dei sistemi di previdenza sociale con una formulazione che per cos dire mi ha lasciato qualche dubbio
italian che sia la solita richiesta che tante volte sotto queste parole nasconde la richiesta di diminuire le prestazioni pensionistiche ai cittadini per diminuire le uscite nei bilanci dei governi nazionali
italian ecco se fosse questa l intenzione della relazione vorrei sottolineare che si dovrebbe invece intendere come una razionalizzazione nell evitare gli sprechi nei pagamenti di prestazioni previdenziali assistenziali che se fossero meglio amministrate eviterebbero di dover continuamente diminuire le prestazioni tagliando le pensioni agli anziani in tutta l europa
italian la relazione in esame fa l apologia delle politiche monetarie della banca centrale europea bce segnatamente della stabilit dei prezzi dimenticando che attualmente non viviamo in un momento di diminuzione continua dei tassi di interesse bens al contrario in una fase di continui aumenti con ripercussioni molto gravi sui redditi delle famiglie con scarse risorse economiche che ricorrono al credito bancario per acquistare una casa di propriet come succede in portogallo
italian per il relatore che si congratula con l attuazione della bce fondamentale l osservazione rigorosa dei criteri di convergenza nominale del patto di stabilit anche per i paesi candidati all adesione e delle politiche connesse in particolar modo la moderazione salariale la flessibilizzazione del mercato del lavoro e dei sistemi di sicurezza sociale e l accelerazione della liberalizzazione dei servizi e dei capitali
italian alle sue critiche il relatore aggiunge anche quella verso i paesi della zona euro che hanno ridotto il tempo di lavoro e cos facendo hanno contribuito dal suo punto di vista a rendere il mercato del lavoro pi rigido invece di renderlo pi flessibile
italian in questo modo il relatore si colloca nella posizione di difesa del pi raffinato neoliberalismo capitalista al quale possiamo replicare solo con le nostre pi vive proteste esprimendo un voto negativo
italian relazione karas a
italian signor presidente verr incontro alle aspettative dell onorevole peijs abbreviando il mio intervento e limitandomi a dire che ho votato a favore di questa relazione con l auspicio che a tutti i pensionati il dicembre venga consegnata una calcolatrice che trasformi la loro moneta in euro
italian signor presidente sono anch io fra i deputati che hanno presentato l emendamento n in cui si chiede che la campagna della commissione a favore dell euro si limiti ai soli paesi che partecipano alla valuta comune
italian ci implica che svezia danimarca e gran bretagna dovrebbero essere mantenute al di fuori da tale campagna fintantoche la corona e la sterlina rimarranno le valute di questi paesi
italian mi pare logico chiedere che l unione non attui nei paesi membri campagne finanziate con fondi pubblici su temi tanto sensibili ai fini della politica interna
italian in ultima analisi una questione di tolleranza e rispetto per i processi democratici di ogni popolo
italian i socialdemocratici danesi oggi hanno votato a favore della relazione dell onorevole karas sulla strategia di comunicazione per la realizzazione dell uem
italian l introduzione delle nuove banconote e monete comuni avr un impatto pratico di enorme portata sui cittadini e sulle aziende non solo perche le monete e le banconote sono nuove ma anche perche sar necessario abituarsi ai nuovi prezzi quando si far la conversione nella moneta unica
italian nel denaro occorre avere fiducia
italian e perci importante che vi sia l informazione necessari che dovr essere naturalmente pi ampia di quella alla quale si assiste oggi quando i paesi mettono in circolazione un nuovo design per le banconote e le monete
italian con il nostro voto abbiamo voluto insistere sul fatto che importante che le attivit di informazione siano svolte nei singoli paesi dagli stati membri e che vengano conclusi in merito accordi separati con i singoli paesi
italian siamo d accordo che giusto che il governo danese non abbia concluso un accordo di questo tipo
italian auspichiamo che anche la danimarca lo possa fare quando la popolazione danese come speriamo avr detto s alla moneta unica in occasione del referendum del settembre
italian il mio partito il partito socialista dei paesi bassi non mai stato favorevole ad un introduzione precipitosa di una moneta comune nell unione europea
italian l euro ci impedisce di regolare l economia mediante l adeguamento dei tassi d interesse e dei corsi di cambio
italian inoltre la cosiddetta stabilit dell euro viene determinata dai grandi risparmi sui redditi di coloro che non lavorano e sui tagli all istruzione alla sanit pubblica all edilizia popolare e ai trasporti pubblici
italian ritengo che l euro sia utile soltanto per gli uomini d affari i ricchi vacanzieri e i deputati del parlamento europeo ma non per la grande maggioranza delle persone
italian la fiducia che c era nell euro assai scemata ora che l euro ha perso valore nei confronti della corona danese della corona svedese della sterlina inglese e delle monete di molti altri paesi al di fuori dell unione europea
italian pertanto posso supporre che i fautori dell euro abbiano adesso bisogno di una campagna propagandistica
italian la relazione karas volta soprattutto a indurre maggiore fiducia nell opinione pubblica nei confronti dell euro fra l altro coinvolgendo associazioni sportive e il mondo della scuola
italian d altro canto il documento vuole puntare il dito contro le prassi di truffatori e speculatori che approfittano dell introduzione dell euro
italian condivido questa parte del testo ma non la proposta nel suo insieme
italian respingo in toto la relazione karas
italian se l obiettivo di far acquisire agli europei familiarit con la loro futura moneta perfettamente legittimo in quanto la decisione di abbandonare le monete nazionali ormai stata presa in condizioni peraltro che non condivido affatto mi oppongo invece fermamente alla propaganda che la relazione karas organizza a favore di quello che il collega chiama un elemento essenziale del processo di integrazione europea atto a favorire lo sviluppo di un identit comune
italian il testo dell onorevole karas ha comunque il merito di portare alla luce l enorme menzogna a cui sono ricorsi nel i sostenitori di un europa federale quando chiesero ai francesi di ratificare il trattato di maastricht la moneta unica veniva allora presentata come uno strumento meramente tecnico per far funzionare meglio l economia nei confronti del dollaro e dello yen nonche come un operazione priva di qualsiasi effetto sulla sovranit nazionale
italian come si era lontani allora dall attuale elemento essenziale del processo di integrazione
italian e indubbio che la relazione karas sar un arma preziosa per tutti coloro che in gran bretagna in svezia e in danimarca lottano per difendere le rispettive democrazie nazionali
italian per quanto i sostenitori dell euro in alcuni paesi oggi lo neghino la moneta unica proprio la macchina da guerra di un europa federale che la stragrande maggioranza dei popoli europei rifiuta
italian quando i miei colleghi quindi respingono l emendamento presentato dall onorevole william abitbol che chiede semplicemente che i programmi di comunicazione della commissione dichiarino apertamente tale obiettivo di integrazione non fanno altro che contribuire ad alimentare una campagna di menzogne che gli elettori sicuramente faranno loro pagare
italian la risoluzione della relazione karas sostiene che le donne per inspiegabili motivi non partecipano dell entusiasmo generale che avrebbe dovuto accompagnare l istituzione dell euro
italian vi si ritrovano pure i toni sgradevoli dei propagandisti rivoluzionari di ogni epoca che in ogni famiglia vedevano un complotto reazionario di preti e donne che rifiutavano un futuro radioso
italian a nessuno sembra essere venuto in mente invece che forse proprio per la loro esperienza di economia domestica quotidiana che le donne nutrono forti riserve sul passaggio alla moneta unica
italian un atteggiamento davvero spregevole che coincide peraltro con la dittatura di quel pensiero uniformante che consiste nel tacciare di ignoranti analfabeti e sottosviluppati gli oppositori o i riluttanti donne o uomini che siano
italian ecco a cosa porta un federalismo cieco
italian relazione lambert a
italian le relazioni annuali presentate ogni anno dal mediatore europeo e dalla commissione per le petizioni sulle attivit da loro svolte fanno parte delle nostre tradizioni
italian ai consuntivi di questi due organi il parlamento risponde a sua volta con due relazioni abbastanza simili da un anno all altro
italian tuttavia vi una novit la relazione thors basata sostanzialmente sui lavori della commissione per gli affari istituzionali e sulla richiesta del mediatore s derman pretende di assegnare alla figura del mediatore un diritto di accesso generalizzato a tutti i documenti la cui consultazione necessaria per l istruzione dei ricorsi
italian ci opponiamo a questa proposta non perche siamo contrari a priori ad un controllo sull operato dell amministrazione ma perche simili poteri vanno ben oltre le competenze di un mediatore e si avvicinano piuttosto a quelle di un giudice
italian e ovvi e non saremo di certo noi ad affermare il contrari che la delirante amministrazione comunitaria e i danni che ne derivano possono soltanto alimentare nei nostri concittadini una sempre maggiore insoddisfazione e di conseguenza un crescente numero di ricorsi
italian ma il potenziamento delle competenze la diversificazione dei campi di intervento e la bulimia legislativa della commissione e della nostra assemblea non risolveranno probabilmente il problema
italian ma nemmeno il mediatore assieme ai suoi collaboratori potr rispondere adeguatamente a tali richieste
italian abbiamo la responsabilit politica di esaurire le fonti stesse di una tale litigiosit anteponendo la qualit del lavoro pratico all attivismo testuale che ci serve talvolta per giustificare la nostra esistenza e rispettando davvero il principio di sussidiariet che eviter all unione di doversi pronunciare su questioni che non la riguardano dovremo esercitare invece noi stessi se occorre le competenze di cui disponiamo in materia di controllo degli organi comunitari
italian troppo spesso abbiamo visto la nostra assemblea nascondersi dietro a comitati di esperti soltanto perche si rifiutava di assumersi le proprie responsabilit politiche
italian se necessario lasciare al mediatore il controllo dei problemi di pura operativit amministrativa noi dobbiamo da parte nostra imparare a tenere costantemente a freno la macchina comunitaria lanciata a folle velocit in una corsa mortale
italian gli eccessi contro cui lottare derivano spesso dalla natura stessa dell attuale costruzione comunitaria e vanno quindi affrontati alla radice
italian relazione atkins a
italian signor presidente non dica all onorevole peijs che non le vengo incontro
italian ho infatti votato a favore della relazione atkins perche per i pensionati che hanno poco da vivere la puntualit di arrivare a destinazione quando prendono l aereo importantissima avendo appunto poco tempo a disposizione
italian questa sessione ricca di relazioni dedicate al tema dei trasporti
italian peccato per dover constatare che il settore viene analizzato unicamente nell ottica della liberalizzazione
italian la relazione dell onorevole atkins che tratta della proposta della commissione europea di creare un cielo unico europeo rientra in questa logica di liberalizzazione a tutto spiano
italian da qui lo sciopero la settimana scorsa dei controllori di volo francesi che hanno cos espresso le loro preoccupazioni per una concezione meramente commerciale della loro professione
italian comprendo la loro protesta contrariamente all onorevole atkins il quale nella sua relazione invita la commissione ad esortare i governi degli stati membri che tollerano oggi che il traffico aereo venga perturbato da vertenze sindacali nazionali ad affrontare urgentemente il problema
italian e semplicemente ridicolo
italian nessuno nega che la situazione del traffico aereo sia peggiorata
italian i corridoi aerei e gli aeroporti in effetti sono saturi i ritardi sono ormai all ordine del giorno un aereo su tre non atterra in orario e al tutto si aggiungono l inquinamento acustico e quello ambientale
italian plaudo quindi alla disponibilit del commissario incaricato del dossier trasporti signora de palacio di afferrare il toro per le corna al fine di giungere rapidamente alla creazione di un cielo unico europeo
italian non sono tuttavia per nulla d accordo sui mezzi che il commissario ci propone cos come disapprovo le proposte contenute nella relazione
italian si tratterebbe infatti di mettere in concorrenza i centri di controllo aereo separando le autorit di controllo del traffico da quelle di fornitura dei servizi
italian la funzione di controllo potrebbe essere esercitata da imprese indipendenti il cui capitale sarebbe aperto alle compagnie aeree oppure ai partner privati
italian una tale liberalizzazione diminuirebbe la sicurezza del trasporto aereo il che sarebbe inaccettabile ed incoerente con il trattato dell unione secondo il quale il miglioramento della sicurezza dei trasporti uno dei principali obiettivi della politica comune dei trasporti
italian la francia certo un caso a se stante rispetto alla maggioranza degli altri paesi europei dove il controllo aereo gestito da agenzie poste sotto la tutela dello stato ma aperte ai capitali privati
italian la francia d altronde ci tiene a preservare la natura pubblica di tale attivit
italian ma necessario applicare il principio di sussidiariet e lasciare ad ogni stato membro la facolt di organizzare il proprio controllo aereo
italian e indispensabile tanto pi che i ritardi non sono imputabili al controllo se non nel percento dei casi a malapena
italian per concludere sostengo le proposte che mirano a consolidare il ruolo di eurocontro l agenzia paneuropea di gestione dello spazio aereo degli stati membri dell unione e di alcuni paesi terz come autorit con funzioni di regolazione
italian la relazione sbaglia nel sottovalutare il potenziale di quest agenzia comunque voto contro una relazione assolutamente inaccettabile
italian ho votato contro la relazione dell onorevole atkins in quanto la ritengo completamente avulsa dalla realt e dettata pi da una visione ideologica aprioristica che non dalla preoccupazione di rispondere alle reali esigenze dei cittadini europei e degli utenti del trasporto aereo
italian con ci non intendo negare di certo la necessit di migliorare la regolazione e il controllo del traffico aereo in europa nell ottica di un cielo unico europeo
italian mi sembra ovvio che gli aerei che attraversano i nostri cieli non possono pi subire l attuale gestione incoerente scoordinata e complicata delle loro traiettorie di volo
italian ed vero che se sono stati realizzati progressi attraverso eurocontrol giunto il momento di andare oltre e di migliorare il dispositivo con un imperativo assolutamente prioritario la sicurezza la regolazione e il controllo del traffico aereo non devono dipendere dalla legge della concorrenza bens dal concetto di servizio di interesse generale
italian d altronde nemmeno gli stati uniti hanno liberalizzato il controllo del traffico aereo la cui gestione affidata ad un agenzia statale
italian il che tutto dire
italian ebbene la relazione atkins persegue l obiettivo di mettere in concorrenza un servizio che non si vede come potrebbe essere fonte di profitto per i privati secondo criteri di efficienza connessi agli utili realizzati
italian d altra parte il pretesto che si adduce a favore della liberalizzazione il ritardo degli aerei
italian e opportuno in effetti porvi rimedio ma affinche questa proposta possa essere efficace sar bene analizzare le cause dei ritardi nonche le effettive possibili soluzioni
italian ricordiamo innanzi tutto che quest anno la situazione talvolta migliorata in quanto i ritardi ad esempio in francia sono notevolmente diminuiti
italian ne consegue che bene comunque distinguere le disfunzioni congiunturali utilizzo dello spazio da parte dei militari per il kosovo cambiamento del sistema di controllo ecc
italian da quelle strutturali
italian bisogna anche valutare la questione delle compagnie aeree o quella della ristrettezza dello spazio civile europeo rispetto al numero di sorvoli
italian la colpa dei ritardi in fondo non tutta del controllo aereo e comunque migliorare il sistema vuole dire coordinare meglio i vari sistemi di controllo negli stati membri rafforzando il ruolo di eurocontrol
italian dovrebbero essere questi l obiettivo e gli orientamenti del cielo unico europeo
italian pare per purtroppo che la commissione non sia di quest idea e la relazione atkins ancora meno
italian il settore del trasporto aereo da moltissimo tempo organizzato in maniera oltremodo liberale
italian il motivo di tutto ci sta nel fatto che le autorit si fanno concorrenza mettendo a disposizione aeroporti sempre pi grandi e numerosi e che al di fuori di quegli aeroporti non sono necessarie altre infrastrutture paragonabili con le ferrovie o le autostrade
italian pertanto in questo settore da lungo tempo abituale che diverse compagnie si facciano la concorrenza sulle medesime rotte
italian anche i prezzi dei biglietti aerei sono una dimostrazione di questa libert non esiste infatti alcun rapporto tra distanza da percorrere e prezzo del volo
italian dove si vogliono pi passeggeri i prezzi sono bassi dove invece si ritiene che ci siano gi passeggeri a sufficienza i prezzi sono alti
italian in questo settore non resta molto da liberalizzare
italian tuttavia ci sono persone che si aspettano da un ulteriore liberalizzazione la panacea a tutti i mali
italian essa porterebbe ad un abbassamento del costo dei biglietti ad un aumento dell offerta di voli e alla scomparsa dei ritardi
italian il gruppo gue ritiene tale valutazione unilaterale in quanto si limita a considerare solo due interessi da un lato quelli delle compagnie aeree dall altro quelli dei consumatori che mirano soltanto a volare a costi sempre pi ridotti
italian a nostro giudizio ci sono altri aspetti che sono pi importanti come la sicurezza dei passeggeri le garanzie occupazionali e la situazione lavorativa del personale la tutela dell ambiente e delle ferrovie dal dumping dei prezzi e da altre forme di concorrenza sleale
italian non ha senso addossare tutte le colpe per i disagi di cui possono soffrire i passeggeri al personale che a volte costretto a scioperare per autodifesa
italian non neppure colpa di eurocontrol che si assunto una serie di funzioni statali transfrontaliere
italian la sicurezza non dev essere subordinata alle mire di profitto di imprese che intendono rilevare il mercato di eurocontrol
italian il problema legato invece alla crescita spropositata del trasporto aereo e alla concorrenza a livello di prezzi che sono andate a scapito del trasporto ferroviario a lungo raggio
italian tale problema non verr risolto con le proposte odierne
italian partendo da questa visione critica abbiamo presentato undici emendamenti
italian poiche emerso che la maggioranza del parlamento non condivide il nostro punto di vista non abbiamo potuto votare a favore della versione definitiva della relazione atkins
italian la presente relazione sebbene parta da alcune situazioni real come l aumento del traffico aereo o i ritardi che si verificano su diverse rott e da alcune premesse corrett segnatamente la necessit di garantire e rafforzare la sicurezza del trasporto aere rivela tuttavia le cause profonde di tali situazioni indivisibili dalle continue liberalizzazioni delle linee aeree e dalla conseguente concorrenza sfrenata
italian in particolare la relazione trae conclusioni precipitose ed errate in quanto chiaramente a favore della liberalizzazione dello spazio aereo e del controllo futuro da parte delle principali linee aeree
italian poiche evidente che in questo settore si impone una cooperazione effettiva e che sono indispensabili misure tecniche e disciplinari non intendiamo sostenere tali orientamenti ancora pi liberali di quelli suggeriti dalla commissione
italian se attuati questi orientamenti non farebbero altro che accentuare le difficolt nel campo della sicurezza e farebbero emergere ulteriori problemi sociali oltre a suscitare problemi relativi alla sovranit di ogni stato sul proprio spazio aereo tanto pi rilevanti nella misura in cui esso condiviso dalle rispettive aviazioni militari
italian il giugno gli addetti al controllo aereo francesi scioperavano per protestare contro i progetti dell unione europea di liberalizzare il controllo aereo ci tengo a dichiarare loro la mia solidariet e il mio rispetto per le rivendicazioni dei sindacati di categoria
italian le risposte alla congestione dello spazio aereo europeo inducono un precipitare degli eventi con il proliferare degli aeroporti e delle piste di decollo e atterraggio il degrado delle condizioni di lavoro dei dipendenti del settore e l aumento dell inquinamento
italian noi siamo invece a favore di uno sviluppo armonizzato dei trasporti su scala europea che privilegi innanzitutto il soddisfacimento dei bisogni sociali reali e che potenzi ad esempio la rete ferroviaria come soluzione alle esigenze dei pi specie per le percorrenze inferiori ai cinquecento chilometri
italian la liberalizzazione del controllo aereo non risolver il problema dei ritardi giacche questi dipendono dal controllo del traffico aereo soltanto per il percento
italian si sa che i servizi militari dispongono oggi in francia ad esempio dell percento dello spazio aereo
italian come mai questo non viene rimesso in discussione
italian la commissione fa leva sui ritardi per proporre la separazione tra un agenzia europea di regolazione e l istituzione di un mercato interno liberalizzato di prestazione di servizi di traffico aereo
italian misure di questo tipo decise per la pressione esercitata dalle compagnie aeree potranno solo andare a scapito della sicurezza tanto pi che le compagnie stesse potranno candidarsi per la fornitura di tali servizi
italian per questi motivi voto contro la presente relazione
italian relazione dami o a
italian ho votato a favore della relazione dami o signor presidente anche perche ho votato a favore dell emendamento che prevede il percento dell indennit di maternit
italian la maternit non una malattia
italian stamattina sui giornali in italia c scritto che ci toglieranno dalle tasse le cure per i cani e per i gatti
italian allora se ci sono soldi per cani e gatti ce ne devono essere anche per le donne che partoriscono che non sono malate ma sono persone che hanno diritto all intera indennit
italian signor presidente la presente relazione concernente l attuazione di misure volte a promuovere il miglioramento della sicurezza e della salute sul lavoro delle lavoratrici gestanti puerpere o in periodo di allattamento certo lodevole e incamminata nella giusta direzione
italian non da ultimo il paragrafo contiene molte proposte positive
italian nel contempo mi preme mettere in guardia contro la tendenza a far s che il parlamento si occupi di politica e legislazione sociale materie a mio avviso di competenza degli stati membri in ogni loro aspetto
italian si tratta di un elemento importante dell identit culturale e sociale di ogni paese e di ogni popolo
italian e si tratta anche di uno degli aspetti pi importanti in ogni campagna elettorale in svezia come in altri paesi
italian lasciamo che resti una competenza nazionale
italian signor presidente la lavoratrice gestante e il bimbo che deve ancora nascere ma lo stesso vale per le lavoratrici puerpere o in periodo di allattamento hanno bisogno del maggior sostegno possibile in una fase della loro vita importante non solo per loro stesse e per il bambino ma per la societ tutta considerando il basso tasso di natalit e l invecchiamento della popolazione attualmente presenti in europa
italian se pur vero che le aziende hanno un ruolo di responsabilit sociale i governi dovrebbero essere certamente di esempio specie in quei paesi come il mio in cui il ruolo della madre e della famiglia tutelato dalla costituzione
italian purtroppo non questo il caso dell irlanda quanto a indennit per congedo di maternit agevolazioni per le necessit connesse all allattamento e esonero dai turni notturni
italian ho citato questi esempi per segnalare che la semplice approvazione di una direttiva non significa automaticamente la sua attuazione
italian non davvero pi tollerabile che nella comunit europea ci si limiti a parlare senza poi agire a favore delle madri lavoratrici dei loro figli e delle famiglie a cui appartengono
italian della presente relazione abbiamo votato i paragrafi che mirano ad una maggiore tutela della donna lavoratrice sia dal punto di vista della sua salute e del suo salario che dal punto di vista della salute dei suoi figli
italian e deplorevole tuttavia che la relazione non proponga nemmeno di allineare in tutti i paesi vantaggi e diritti a quelli pi favorevoli riconosciuti in alcuni paesi alle donne gestanti che lavorano
italian d altra parte non vogliamo che il nostro voto a favore di una tutela specifica durante la gravidanza delle donne che lavorano di notte possa essere interpretato come il riconoscimento della legittimit del lavoro notturno femminile
italian anzi vogliamo ribadire qui la nostra opposizione al lavoro notturno quando non socialmente utile non solo delle donne ma anche degli uomini
italian il divieto del lavoro notturno delle donne fu una conquista del movimento operaio in francia
italian ritornarci ora sarebbe una vera regressione sociale
italian tirare in ballo la parit dei sessi poi sarebbe soltanto ipocrisia
italian un ipocrisia destinata a celare il fatto che il legislatore pi attento ad assicurare ai padroni un uso proficuo dei macchinari di produzione che non a garantire salute e sicurezza sul lavoro ai suoi dipendenti
italian en mi sono astenuto sull emendamento n presentato a firma dell onorevole bushill matthews con il quale si chiedeva il riconoscimento di particolari necessit delle pmi in fase di attuazione delle norme sulla salute e la sicurezza
italian ho la massima considerazione per tale richiesta ma l emendamento superfluo dato che l articolo del trattato afferma chiaramente che le direttive in materia sociale evitano di imporre vincoli amministrativi finanziari e giuridici di natura tale da ostacolare la creazione e lo sviluppo di piccole e medie imprese
italian credo quindi che l auspicio espresso nell emendamento sia gi soddisfatto e che non sia necessario formularlo nuovamente nella relazione in esame
italian ci troviamo di nuovo di fronte ad una raffica di buone intenzioni che anche qualora si traducano in una serie di proposte positive sono condannate a restare lettera morta poiche evitano di affrontare l essenza del problema o l orientamento principale che lo determina
italian la proposta del parlamento europeo contiene molti spunti positivi che per vengono annullati dalla sua stessa pecca di voler affrontare in modo globale il problema dell impatto negativo sul lavoro e sulle relazioni industriali in quanto non mette in discussione l orientamento fondamentale costituito dalla riorganizzazione delle relazioni industriali e dall annullamento dei diritti e delle conquiste dei lavoratori il quadro che ne emerg flessibilit dell orario e delle condizioni di lavoro occupazione temporanea e a tempo parziale tagli alla previdenza e alla protezione social assolutamente negativo e ostacola l attuazione di qualsiasi politica di tutela delle donne lavoratrici durante e dopo la gravidanza
italian vorremmo richiamare l attenzione sui rischi inerenti al divieto assoluto di licenziare specie nell attuale e diffuso sistema di estensione dei contratti di lavoro atipici sull esclusione indiretta dalla procedura di assunzione delle gestanti sull esigenza non solo di mantenere e tutelare ma anzi di estendere il congedo di maternit sull esistenza di una definizione chiara del congedo retribuito sull esecuzione di controlli pi rigorosi e sostanziali sul lavoro notturno delle lavoratrici gestanti e puerpere
italian nel contempo con il rafforzamento del quadro giuridico di tutela relativo alla sicurezza e alla salute delle gestanti volto a colmare le lacune e a far luce sui lati oscuri che potrebbero diventare eventuali scappatoie si deve fronteggiare la mancanza di volont politica da parte degli stati membri di attuare tale tutela mancanza facilmente dimostrabile con l atteggiamento assunto dagli organismi di controllo degli stati membri nel periodo precedente
italian e indicativo l esempio della grecia e dei suoi controlli lacunosi sull obbligo per i datori di lavoro di elaborare per iscritto una valutazione completa dei rischi professionali sul posto di lavoro in cui deve rientrare anche un analisi specifica dei pericoli per le lavoratrici gestanti e puerpere
italian la realt dimostra che quando la capacit di occupazione e l adattabilit diventano le linee guida delle priorit comunitarie in materia d occupazione la protezione si rivela inesistente e le singole norme vengono in pratica cancellate
italian resta da vedere quali siano gli orientamenti prescelti e che tipo di politica per l occupazione si preferisca seguire
italian come si potuto constatare l unione purtroppo persiste in un ulteriore riduzione drastica delle indennit e della previdenza sociale modifica in peggio le disposizioni relative ai licenziamenti e limita o abolisce le normative di tutela concernenti le condizioni di lavoro
italian non ci si pu illudere nemmeno sulla natura della politica per l occupazione e pi in generale della politica sociale dell ue ne tanto meno sugli interessi che essa predilige per tali motivi pur condividendo la posizione positiva del parlamento in materia di tutela delle lavoratrici gestanti riteniamo che si tratti semplicemente dell ennesima espressione di buone intenzioni
italian invitiamo pertanto le lavoratrici e i lavoratori a proseguire la lotta sociale per una modifica globale della politica attuata promuovendone una diversa che abbia come fulcro l uomo e il rispetto dei suoi bisogni e della sua dignit
italian lo scopo primario di questa lotta la realizzazione del principio dell occupazione piena e stabile con diritti sociali totali per tutti
italian solo cos si potranno garantire i diritti della categoria particolarmente vulnerabile delle gestanti i diritti e il rispetto della vita che non una materia prima per accrescere i profitti ne soggetta alle leggi crudeli dei costi della concorrenza e del mercato
italian siamo favorevoli a qualsiasi modifica della direttiva che punti a una maggiore tutela delle lavoratrici gestanti prima durante e dopo il congedo di maternit
italian la risoluzione propone di colmare le lacune dell attuale direttiva e di armonizzare le legislazioni europee per allinearle a quelle che garantiscono il maggior numero di diritti
italian sottoscriviamo tali proposte in nome della garanzia del diritto alla salute dei lavoratori subordinati tanto pi che i progetti di modifica della convenzione dell organizzazione internazionale del lavoro sulla protezione della maternit convenzione ci fanno temere un involuzione con l esclusione di alcune donne dal beneficio del congedo di maternit la durata minima dello stesso e la possibilit di licenziare una lavoratrice durante la gravidanza
italian e necessario predisporre un rigoroso quadro europeo che tuteli le donne gestanti da qualsiasi forma di discriminazione nella procedura di assunzione relativamente alle condizioni di lavoro all accesso e alla durata del congedo di maternit venti settimane di cui otto obbligatorie dopo il parto
italian esse devono essere protette da qualsiasi licenziamento abusivo e deve essere loro garantito il livello salariale antecedente la gravidanza
italian infine il lavoro notturno di donne e uomini deve essere vietato nei settori in cui non strettamente indispensabile anziche essere riorganizzato per le donne gestanti
italian sviluppo del traffico marittimo a corto raggio
italian l ordine del giorno reca la relazione a presentata dalla onorevole peijs a nome della commissione per la politica regionale i trasporti e il turismo su una comunicazione della commissione al consiglio al parlamento europeo al comitato economico e sociale e al comitato delle regioni sullo sviluppo del trasporto marittimo a corto raggio in europa un alternativa dinamica in una catena di trasporto sostenibile
italian seconda relazione biennale di avanzamento
italian la parola alla relatrice onorevole peijs
italian signor presidente nel la commissione present sulla base della strategia formulata nel libro bianco sulla politica comune dei trasporti la comunicazione sullo sviluppo del trasporto marittimo a corto raggio
italian adesso disponiamo della seconda relazione annuale di avanzamento al riguardo
italian tuttavia dopo cinque anni evidente che il trasporto marittimo a corto raggio rimasto una bella promessa che non stata mantenuta malgrado il sostegno verbale espresso in occasione del consiglio trasporti dell dicembre che individuava in tale settore una priorit
italian non per idealismo che cerchiamo di esaltare il trasporto marittimo a corto raggio come il trasporto marittimo per eccellenza
italian il fatto che nei prossimi dieci anni questo settore registrer un aumento del percento
italian e impossibile rispondere alla crescente domanda soltanto con il trasporto su strada
italian il trasporto marittimo a corto raggio non rappresenta un concorrente del trasporto su strada su rotaia o fluviale bens una delle modalit della catena di trasporto
italian tutti abbiamo interesse a mantenere entro limiti il pi possibile ristretti l insofferenza della gente a causa della contiguit tra le abitazioni e le arterie dove scorre il traffico pesante
italian inoltre il trasporto deve avvenire per quanto possibile nel rispetto dell ambiente e anche in tale prospettiva il trasporto marittimo risponde ad elevati requisiti
italian la velocit non rappresenta forse la caratteristica principale di questo settore ma la sicurezza s
italian divieti di circolazione durante il fine settimana e ingorghi del traffico mettono a dura prova il trasporto su strada
italian in molti casi il trasporto marittimo a corto raggio pu risolvere tali problemi se utilizzato ad integrazione di altre forme di trasporto
italian non intendo comunque sostenere che esso rappresenti sempre una soluzione a tutti i problemi
italian elimineremo molti problemi gi se ci impegneremo a sfruttare e a combinare al meglio le modalit di trasporto esistenti ma a tale scopo bisogna rispettare determinate condizioni
italian nella sua comunicazione la commissione fa un esplicito riferimento alle imprese
italian ci senza dubbio possibile ma in qualit di relatrice desidero rimettere un po in equilibrio le cose
italian su alcuni punti sono chiaramente soprattutto le autorit nazionali locali e regional a poter far sentire il loro peso e imprimere un impulso al trasporto marittimo a corto raggio
italian la commissione ha cercato nella comunicazione di valutare sistematicamente il problema
italian il parlamento e la relatrice hanno analizzato con occhio critico i progetti della commissione e hanno elaborato la relazione qui in esame nell ambito di un dialogo con tutte le parti interessate cos come si addice al parlamento
italian e stato chiesto alle imprese di far presenti quegli elementi pratici che a loro giudizio ostacolano lo sviluppo del trasporto marittimo a corto raggio siamo tuttora in attesa della relazione
italian desidero sottolineare alcuni aspetti
italian ribadisco che questo settore pu avere successo in europa soltanto se verr considerato una parte integrante della catena di trasporto
italian collegamenti con l entroterra mediante rotaia lungo le acque interne e su strada sono indispensabili in tale contesto
italian pertanto occorre assicurare l integrazione con le altre modalit di trasporto e ci pone delle esigenze a livello di infrastrutture
italian il trasporto marittimo a corto raggio anche particolarmente adatto per il trasporto specializzato mi riferisco ad esempio alle automobili
italian in questo ambito riveste enorme importanza l innovazione nella costruzione di navi specializzate che pu inoltre dare impulso alla cantieristica
italian grande rilevanza assume anche l immagine di questo tipo di trasporto che dev essere migliorata
italian il settore del trasporto marittimo a corto raggio soffre sotto il peso della burocrazia
italian le procedure si protraggono all infinito
italian tuttavia un po alla volta si stanno anche evidenziando gli aspetti positivi
italian e qui che le imprese devono assumersi le loro responsabilit ad esempio istituendo uffici regionali di promozione e di marketing il mercato per non pu farcela da solo
italian gli stati membri devono eliminare gli ostacoli
italian mi riferisco ad esempio al monopolio del trasporto su strada con tutte le relative conseguenze per i prezzi a cui si deve adeguare il trasporto marittimo a corto raggio nello short sea port di bilbao
italian dappertutto sono previste per l accompagnamento del carico procedure burocratiche spropositate e un infinita serie di formalit amministrative
italian ci danneggia il trasporto marittimo a corto raggio rispetto ad altre forme di trasporto
italian il parlamento chiede di adottare un approccio flessibile nei confronti del settore in modo che esso possa conquistare una posizione migliore per quanto concerne i prezzi
italian ci riferiamo per esempio ad un esenzione dai servizi di pilotaggio per quei porti in cui il comandante ha evidentemente acquisito notevole esperienza
italian peraltro su questo punto si incappati in un errore particolarmente spiacevole
italian nel documento si parla di esperienza dei piloti ovvio che si deve parlare del comandante perche in caso contrario sarebbe un assurdit
italian in questo momento il mercato ancora frammentato
italian pertanto nella sua relazione il parlamento richiama l attenzione sull esigenza di un approccio del tipo one stop shop a livello di offerta di servizi logistici agli utenti finali che devono comprendere tutti i servizi di trasporto multimodale ponendo cos fine all attuale frammentazione dei servizi
italian nella relazione esorto inoltre la commissione a varare misure d incentivazione occorrono infatti degli stimoli per incoraggiare il trasporto marittimo a corto raggio
italian in riferimento ai collegamenti europei chiedo poi progetti d investimento in particolare per il bacino del mediterraneo e per i porti che si affacciano sull adriatico
italian il trasporto marittimo a corto raggio ha bisogno di destinazioni
italian a rotterdam si possono avere splendidi short sea terminal ma ci vogliono anche delle mete
italian nella messa a punto di nuove linee necessaria la massa critica e possono essere necessari uno o due anni prima di raggiungerla
italian per poter superare questa difficolt l unione europea dovr contribuire con prestiti a basso costo della bei
italian mancano inoltre dati e statistiche sui quali le imprese possano basarsi per i loro investimenti
italian nessuno sa che cosa trasportiamo come verso quali destinazioni e in che quantit
italian penso che le statistiche su ci che trasportiamo e verso quali destinazioni rappresentino uno degli elementi di cui abbiamo urgente bisogno per poter portare avanti una politica per il settore dei trasporti che nei prossimi anni registrer un aumento tanto rilevante
italian signor presidente a nome dei colleghi ripoll e perez alvarez che hanno lavorato su questa relazion ma che hanno dovuto assentarsi desidero congratularmi con la relatrice onorevole peijs per l eccellente relazione presentata soprattutto perche affronta un importante problema da un punto di vista estremamente reale e pratico
italian vorrei inoltre esprimere il mio rammarico per due circostanze la prima che non sia possibile conoscere l opinione del nostro amico fatuzzo riguardo agli effetti del trasporto marittimo a corto raggio sugli interessi dei pensionati europei e in secondo luogo che siano cos pochi i colleghi deputati presenti dato che pensando agli egoistici interessi di quest assemblea probabile che un giorno rimpiangano di avere trascurato il trasporto marittimo a corto raggio poiche forse uno di questi giorni dovremo utilizzarlo per poter andare e venire da strasburgo
italian entrando nel merito della questione bisogna dire alla onorevole peijs che abbiamo seguito con grande interesse gli sviluppi e le azioni che negli ultimi anni e particolarmente in seguito alla costituzione del forum delle industrie marittime sono stati realizzati nell unione europea per promuovere il trasporto marittimo a corto raggio come alternativa al trasporto terrestre
italian sia la relazione della commissione che quella della relatrice mettono in evidenza vantaggi di tipo diverso nella comparazione fra i due tipi di trasporto riguardo al trasporto marittimo sottolineerei la minore saturazione delle infrastrutture il costo inferiore delle stesse il minor consumo energetic con la conseguente minore emissione di sostanze inquinanti nell atmosfer ed il miglioramento delle comunicazioni con le regioni periferiche dell unione europea
italian riteniam e credo che su questo siamo tutti d accord che il trasferimento di traffico dalla modalit terrestre a quella marittima dovrebbe diventare un obiettivo prioritario delle politiche di trasporto dell unione europea
italian vorrei evidenziare il fatto che negli ultimi anni sono state prese numerose iniziative che hanno avuto effetti positivi per il trasporto marittimo a corto raggio
italian ci ha reso possibile come segnala la relazione della commissione un aumento dell attivit del trasporto marittimo intracomunitario del percento tra il e il
italian si tratta tuttavia di un aumento oggettivamente modest soltanto il percento annuo accumulat ed inferiore a quello registrato nello stesso periodo dalla modalit terrestre pari al percento
italian di conseguenza invece di un avvicinamento delle posizioni relative fra trasporto marittimo e stradale si verificato un ulteriore aumento del differenziale
italian tutto pertanto indica che non soltanto sono necessarie misure quantitativamente pi energiche ma che c probabilmente bisogno di un approccio qualitativamente diverso
italian la relazione della onorevole peijs ci sembra molto equilibrata ma vorremmo richiamare l attenzione su uno degli obiettivi chiave per la promozione del trasporto marittimo a corto raggio la contemporanea riduzione dei tempi e dei costi diretti relativi alle operazioni portuali delle imbarcazioni che effettuano questo genere di servizi
italian i servizi portual sia per le navi che per le merc vengono spesso prestati senza un effettiva concorrenza o con una concorrenza molto limitata ne consegue che si verifichino frequentemente abusi di posizione dominante come l imposizione di servizi obbligatori che non sono necessari e che non vengono nemmeno utilizzat per esempio il pilotaggio il rimorchio l ormeggio o la movimentazione portual o come il pagamento di tariffe molto elevate
italian il dato certo che salvo limitate eccezioni i servizi marittimi transoceanici non devono affrontare la concorrenza delle strade e nella maggior parte dei casi nemmeno il trasporto aereo costituisce una reale concorrenza per questo genere di servizi
italian pensiamo quindi che se si vuole promuovere il trasporto marittimo a corto raggio in modo realistico ed efficace indispensabile rivedere il modo in cui vengono attualmente prestati i servizi portuali migliorandone l efficienza e riducendone i costi
italian bisogna altres considerare le conseguenze per l economia delle zone in cui presente l industria navale dato che tutto ci costituirebbe una forma di rilancio per queste aree come ben sa chi vive in quelle citt e in quelle regioni in cui l industria navale rappresenta un elemento attivo dell economia locale
italian signor presidente signor commissario onorevoli colleghi mi stato chiesto perche ci impegniamo cos tanto a livello europeo per il trasporto marittimo a corto raggio
italian la risposta questa abbiamo un grande visione
italian navi sicure ed ecologiche trasportano attorno al nostro continente grandi quantitativi di merci
italian le merci vengono scaricate dove sono pi vicine via terra alla loro destinazione finale
italian si alleggeriscono cos i trasporti via terra perche si completa un altro anello della catena di trasporto intermodale
italian siamo lontani mille miglia da questa realt vero anche se negli ultimi tempi stato fatto qualcosa come si desume dalla relazione
italian l ottima relazione della onorevole pejjs affronta le attuali difficolt e le strategie attuate per realizzare il nostro obiettivo
italian si giunti ad un ampio consenso in seno alla commissione
italian che cosa possiamo fare internamente a favore del trasporto marittimo a corto raggio
italian vorrei citare soltanto alcuni esempi da un punto di vista tecnico possiamo sviluppare motori ecologici e terminal specifici che consentano un rapido trasbordo delle merci
italian dal punto di vista organizzativo i temi da affrontare riguardano in particolare i traffici transfrontalieri la standardizzazione dei documenti di trasporto la semplificazione dei procedimenti amministrativi e un minor ricorso ai servizi di pilotaggio qualora essi non risultino assolutamente indispensabili
italian cosa possiamo fare per il trasporto marittimo a corto raggio quale anello della catena intermodale
italian innanzitutto migliorare le interfacce con altri mezzi di trasporto mediante attrezzature moderne per il trasbordo delle merc in particolare per quanto riguarda il trasporto fluviale unificare i container favorire i servizi di logistica dei trasporti per la catena di trasporto nel suo complesso e adottare molte altre misure previste nella relazione
italian ritengo che tali riflessioni dovrebbero tener conto anche della strategia di preadesione
italian nel frattempo si tengono tavole rotonde sul tema
italian nella relazione si auspica l utilizzo di metodi di best practice
italian ed giusto altrimenti per quale motivo sosterremmo da qualche tempo un centro di riferimento per il trasporto intermodale
italian sarebbe sensato fare pi ricerca e soprattutto creare progetti dimostrativi nel settore intermodale
italian la relazione offre nel suo complesso un pacchetto di proposte sensate e mi auguro che tra due anni quando ci sar la prossima relazione ci saremo avvicinati un po di pi al nostro obiettivo ad un funzionante sistema di trasporto intermodale in europa
italian signor presidente ci sono tre aspetti dell ottima relazione della onorevole peijs che desidero sottolineare e illustrare per mezzo di un esempio il quale pur riferendosi al mio collegio elettorale so essere rappresentativo della situazione di molte regioni simili a quella da cui provengo
italian mi riferisco in primo luogo all intermodalit e alla necessit di ottimizzare le infrastrutture di collegamento con l entroterra
italian questa settimana abbiamo approvato alcune misure finalizzate al rispetto dell ambiente con le quali si intende promuovere un maggiore utilizzo del trasporto di merci su rotaia
italian in tale contesto essenziale che l accesso ferroviario ai porti sia di ottima qualit
italian dobbiamo tuttavia prendere atto che in taluni casi sia la strada a fornire il necessario accesso all entroterra
italian voglio citare a questo riguardo l inclusione nel piano delle reti transeuropee dell autostrada a che da gretna porta a stranraer in considerazione della sua importanza per il trasporto marittimo da e verso l irlanda del nord
italian in secondo luogo si deve considerare in quale misura le regioni e le isole periferiche dipendano dai trasporti marittimi per le relazioni con le regioni vicine
italian spesso pensiamo al mare come a un fattore di separazione tra le diverse comunit quando dovremmo invece considerarlo una sorta di collegamento autostradale
italian per questo motivo il mio gruppo accoglie con favore gli emendamenti nn
italian e voglio poi aggiungere che in tema di compatibilit ambientale dovremmo considerare nello stesso modo i collegamenti tra penisole
italian nella zona occidentale della scozia la distanza via mare tra gourock e dunoon inferiore di venti volte rispetto al tragitto via terra e per il tragitto da tarbert a portavadie la distanza si accorcia fino a venticinque volte
italian voglio poi sottolineare quanto sia necessario che il parlamento continui a riconoscere il carattere essenziale di molti tragitti marittimi di corto raggio e non mi riferisco solo alla necessit di sostenere gli obblighi del servizio pubblico
italian dobbiamo infatti trovare altre vie percorribili per ridurre i costi connessi con il trasporto verso le isole e le comunit periferiche
italian le economie di queste zone sono sempre contraddistinte da una certa fragilit e non certamente giusto che i contadini dell isola di lewis debbano pagare per il fieno il doppio di quanto pagano i contadini che vivono nell area di inverness
italian spero che la commissione voglia considerare con attenzione quanto ho indicato quando si tratter di sviluppare una politica relativa a questo settore
italian signor presidente il mio gruppo accoglie con favore la relazione della onorevole peijs e la posizione della commissione a cui la relazione stessa risponde
italian e effettivamente vero che il traffico marittimo a corto raggio sia compatibile con l ambiente e vantaggioso in termini di costo ed del pari vero che esso costituisca un fattore di sostegno per lo sviluppo economico delle regioni marittime noi che proveniamo dalla scozia tuttavia chiediamo alla commissione di agire con responsabilit in vista dell imminente liberalizzazione del trasporto marittimo nella scozia occidentale
italian come ha appena ricordato la onorevole attwool in scozia la questione riguarda non solo il trasporto verso le isole ma anche i collegamenti marittimi di breve percorso lungo i cosiddetti lochs ovvero in termini geologici i fiordi l attraversamento via nave di questi stretti bracci di mare consente di evitare percorsi di chilometri lungo strade strette che si inerpicano sui passi di montagna
italian dovessimo interpretare con buon senso la normativa in materia di cabotaggio dovremmo dire che ovvio che queste penisole siano equivalenti in termini funzionali alle isole e che gli obblighi del servizio pubblico si applicano anche ad esse rendendo legittimo il sostegno dello stato ai servizi di trasporto
italian allo stesso modo si dovrebbe considerare in maniera complessiva l insieme dei tragitti che attraversano la scozia occidentale invece di spezzettarlo e prospettare una facile raccolta di utili a quegli imprenditori privati che intendono gestire i pochi tragitti economicamente vantaggiosi rendendo pi arduo sostenere quei tragitti che non producano profitto nel corso dell intero anno
italian chiediamo insomma che il problema sia considerato in modo complessivo in tutta l europa e auspichiamo che la commissione adotti un impostazione improntata ad una maggiore previdenza
italian gi sei settimane or sono ho rivolto alla commissione un interrogazione chiedendo se essa avesse intenzione di trattare le penisole in maniera equivalente alle isole
italian prima dell interrogazione la commissione aveva vantato una profonda conoscenza della scozia occidentale
italian non ho ancora ricevuto risposta e chiedo perci alla commissione di replicare considerando l urgenza della questione
italian signor presidente signora relatrice onorevoli colleghi la comunicazione della commissione sullo sviluppo del trasporto marittimo a corto raggio in europa e la successiva ottima relazione della onorevole peijs ci forniscono un quadro realistico dell andamento registrato negli ultimi due anni da questa ecologica modalit di trasporto
italian e stato soprattutto grazie allo sviluppo e alla promozione del trasporto marittimo a corto raggio che si potuto compiere un passo importante verso la realizzazione di un sistema di trasporto multimodale nell unione europea e nelle regioni confinanti
italian efficienza costi favorevoli compatibilit ambientale e sostenibilit sono gli elementi che distinguono il trasporto marittimo a corto raggio dal trasporto su strada rendendolo una valida alternativa a quest ultimo nelle zone costiere
italian tuttavia occorre anche potenziare l interazione tra le diverse modalit di trasporto per consentire ai peculiari elementi di forza di ciascuna modalit di esprimersi al meglio
italian a tal fine sono necessari una serie di provvedimenti di sostegno a livello europeo nazionale e regionale da parte del settore pubblico e di quello privato affinche i porti che costituiscono il punto nevralgico della catena di trasporto si possano orientare e sviluppare in modo mirato alle esigenze specifiche
italian inoltre si devono modificare i requisiti tecnici ed organizzativi come ad esempio le formalit amministrative e la documentazione le procedure doganali e di scarico in maniera tale da consentire un passaggio rapido e tranquillo da una modalit di trasporto ad un altra e da un paese ad un altro
italian vanno poi compiuti ulteriori passi per favorire il trasporto marittimo a corto raggio introducendo incentivi speciali al fine di sviluppare tecnologie innovative costruire terminal per il disbrigo delle operazioni che siano riservati esclusivamente a questa modalit nonche favorire l integrazione dei porti nella strategia di sviluppo delle regioni costiere
italian fare tutto ci di importanza fondamentale nell ottica del rafforzamento della coesione economica e sociale e dei legami tra i centri e le regioni periferiche all interno dell unione europea
italian la crescente collaborazione economica tra l unione e i paesi confinanti e il conseguente aumento del bisogno di trasporto possono trovare un efficiente realizzazione grazie all integrazione del trasporto marittimo a corto raggio nella catena logistica delle forniture da porta a porta
italian signor presidente intervengo a nome del collega van dam
italian la politica dei trasporti esige delle scelte
italian una politica dei trasporti sostenibile esige ancora pi o in ogni caso altre scelte
italian il compito che spetta a quest assemblea consiste nell agevolare i flussi di merci e di persone in modo da provocare il minor numero possibile di ripercussioni negative
italian la forma di trasporto in esame il trasporto marittimo a corto raggio ha la reputazione di essere una forma di trasporto che rappresenta da pi di un punto di vista un alternativa alle conseguenze negative del settore dei trasporti in particolare occupazione dello spazio e inquinamento ambientale
italian tuttavia come sottolineato giustamente dalla onorevole peijs il settore non sfrutta al massimo le opportunit che gli vengono offerte
italian desidero evidenziare alcuni punti
italian spesso sentiamo dire che il trasporto marittimo a corto raggi e il trasporto su vie d acqua in gener costituiscono una forma ecologica per quanto riguarda le emissioni per unit trasportata
italian ci vero se visto in un ottica relativa
italian tuttavia l evoluzione registrata in questo ambito da altri settori in particolare dal trasporto su strada mette a rischio questa posizione
italian bisogna intervenire con urgenza prima che sia troppo tardi
italian in considerazione degli sviluppi manifestatisi nel settore del trasporto su strada in seguito alle nuove norme europee in materia di emissioni previste per i carburanti ritengo che sia necessario stimolare un miglioramento delle prestazioni ambientali del trasporto marittimo a corto raggio varando una direttiva europea sulle emissioni massime consentite dei motori delle navi
italian inoltre a differenza di alcuni colleghi penso che il trasporto marittimo a corto raggio debba fungere non soltanto da integrazione delle modalit di trasporto esistenti ma anche da alternativa ai flussi di trasporto intracomunitari
italian tenuto conto della problematica relativa alla distribuzione e allo sconto sugli eco punti in austria estremamente opportuna una rotta alternativa sull asse nord sud
italian in tale contesto una parte del traffico pu senz altro essere assorbita dal trasporto marittimo a corto raggio
italian un terzo punto riguarda la situazione nei porti
italian se il trasporto marittimo a corto raggio intende diventare pi competitivo anche per quanto concerne la velocit occorre varare misure in materia di sdoganamento e attivit di carico e scarico come giustamente evidenziato dalla relatrice
italian se poi questo settore funzioner meglio e in maniera pi moderna sar necessario rendere note le opportunit che offre
italian in alcuni stati fra cui i paesi bassi sono stati realizzati a tale scopo e con successo uffici d informazione
italian si raccomanda inoltre che le autorit nazionali e regionali contribuiscano in questo modo alla crescita del settore
italian in breve la relazione della onorevole peijs assai completa e mi congratulo per il lavoro svolto
italian se gli interessati si assumeranno le loro responsabilit tra un paio d anni non potremo fare altro che concludere con un motto che nei paesi bassi gi ben conosciuto trasporto via acqua la via migliore
italian signor presidente per i visitatori stranieri la traversata verso le isole scozzesi un esperienza romantica e in effetti la bellezza di quei luoghi non manca mai di stupire sia la gente del luogo che i turisti
italian per per coloro che l risiedono e si guadagnano da vivere i servizi marittimi verso le isole hanno certamente un importanza vitale ma sono anche un ostacolo oneroso che limita il benessere sociale ed economico
italian gli oneri non riguardano solo le tariffe spesso impegnative ma anche gli inconvenienti legati alla prenotazione alle file di attesa alla necessit di adeguarsi ad orari che prevedono poche corse e per giunta soggette a variazioni vi poi da mettere in conto il rischio di ritardi e cancellazioni dovuti alle condizioni meteorologiche o a guasti meccanici o ancora a scioperi che di tanto in tanto relegano le isole in una condizione di isolamento forzato
italian le isole scozzesi seguono con preoccupazione la politica dell unione europea in materia di concorrenza la quale richiedendo di sottoporre i servizi di trasporto a gare improntate appunto al principio della concorrenza comprometterebbe la qualit di questi essenziali servizi gi al livello in cui essi si trovano adesso e provocherebbe un ulteriore spinta verso l alto del costo della vita e dei costi legati alla conduzione di attivit economiche
italian dobbiamo invece rassicurare coloro che vivono e lavorano su queste vulnerabili isole e sulle pi remote penisole dicendo loro che non avranno nulla da temere dall introduzione di misure di concorrenza nel processo di aggiudicazione dei servizi in oggetto
italian vorrei perci chiedere alla commissione di fare quanto le possibile per rassicurare la popolazione isolana il parlamento e il governo della scozia che peraltro sta affrontando con difficolt l attuale situazione e di affermare la propria disponibilit a garantire che il processo di liberalizzazione si svolga correttamente senza peggiorare ma anzi migliorando i servizi marittimi delle isole scozzesi
italian colgo l occasione per chiedere al commissario verheugen di trasmettere alla sua collega il commissario ai trasporti signora de palacio l invito ad accompagnarmi in una romantica gita nelle isole della scozia
italian signor presidente signor commissario onorevoli colleghi essendo un isolano che vive in un paese con coste molto estese e moltissime isole conosco assai bene l importanza del trasporto marittimo a corto raggio
italian il settore fondamentale chiaramente rappresentato dal trasporto passeggeri mentre la relazione in discussione si concentra sul trasporto delle merci e fa riferimento ad una comunicazione della commissione in proposito
italian vale la pena ricordare che malgrado l aumento del volume dei trasporti di questo genere negli ultimi anni il trasporto su strada cresciuto molto di pi ci significa che si deve prestare particolare attenzione al trasporto marittimo che pi rispettoso dell ambiente
italian la sua immagine attuale non affatto attraente per il consumatore che lo considera alquanto sorpassato lento e complesso
italian ulteriori ostacoli allo sviluppo del trasporto marittimo sono rappresentati dalle procedure amministrative certo migliorabili dai ritardi dalle infrastrutture incomplete dalle tasse portuali non sempre trasparenti nonche dagli oneri di ormeggio che si potrebbero evitare
italian e comunque possibile migliorare quest immagine presentando il trasporto marittimo come un alternativa duratura per i carichi trasportabili con altre modalit
italian mi riferisco naturalmente alle localit che non sono dipendono esclusivamente dal trasporto marittimo come accade invece per le isole che necessitano sempre di particolare attenzione
italian pur essendo fondamentale il ruolo del settore privato vi sono aspetti del mercato che impongono l intervento degli enti pubblici a livello regionale nazionale ed europeo e un apposito contributo economico affinche gli abitanti delle isole non si sentano cittadini europei di seconda categoria
italian lo sviluppo del cabotaggio una conseguenza diretta del progresso socioeconomico delle nostre regioni e quindi della coesione nell unione
italian e certo con questo spirito che la relatrice ha affrontato la problematica occupandosene con grande seriet e credo che ad un isolano come me non resti che congratularmi con lei
italian ringrazio anche il commissario verheugen che sta ascoltando la traduzione in cuffia per l attenzione riservata alle dichiarazioni di voto degli onorevoli colleghi che mi hanno preceduto
italian signor presidente onorevoli colleghi signor commissario la relazione della onorevole peijs che tratta dei trasporti marittimi a corto raggio e chiede agli stati membri e alla commissione l adozione di misure che promuovano questo genere di trasporti appare estremamente opportuna in quanto coincide con il nostro tentativo di correggere le disparit regionali
italian mi permetto come sempre di ricordare che la politica regionale e strutturale dell unione costituisce nel suo insieme una risposta alle specifiche difficolt che devono affrontare alcune regioni europee come le cosiddette regioni ultraperiferiche
italian la commissione ha presentato nel marzo scorso una relazione nella quale si delinea una strategia orientata allo sviluppo sostenibile di queste aree e che prevede vari aspetti principali fra cui quello dei rapporti delle regioni ultraperiferiche con i rispettivi contesti geografici che ne condizionano in buona parte lo sviluppo
italian valutiamo dunque in modo positivo la relazione della onorevole peijs soprattutto se perfezionata grazie all emendamento da me presentato riguardo all inclusione del trasporto via mare fra porti situati nelle regioni ultraperiferiche e nei paesi del loro contesto geografico
italian si potr in tal modo correggere l errore in cui incorsa la commissione allorche ha elaborato la relazione biennale sullo sviluppo di questo genere di trasporti avendo utilizzato una definizione incompleta del trasporto marittimo a corto raggio
italian signor presidente signor commissario onorevoli colleghi per le regioni periferiche il trasporto marittimo a corto raggio decisamente la soluzione pi economica efficace e appropriata
italian ringrazio la onorevole peijis per l interessante e buona relazione
italian nel mio paese il trasporto marittimo quasi interamente costituito dal trasporto a corto raggio che ha dunque per noi una grande importanza
italian rappresentiamo un eccezione anche perche siamo collegati via terra agli altri paesi dell unione europea solo al nostro confine settentrionale per cui il traffico marittimo riveste un enorme significato
italian oltretutto le nostre linee ferroviarie hanno uno scartamento diverso da quello degli altri paesi dell unione
italian l aspetto pi particolare per dato dal fatto che il trasporto marittimo si ferma sempre d inverno a meno che non si adottino misure adeguate perche il mare si ghiaccia
italian a causa di ci ci siamo dovuti dotare di una flotta speciale di navi rompighiaccio si tratta di navi potenti l energia di una delle quali corrisponde all energia usata da una citt
italian cos stando le cose ossia avendo noi questo ostacolo alla circolazione speriamo che sia possibile finanziare l impiego delle navi rompighiaccio dato che l ostacolo stato messo da dio e noi non possiamo farci assolutamente nulla
italian e inoltre deprecabile che non siano messi abbastanza in evidenza i risvolti sociali e occupazionali del traffico marittimo
italian la forza lavoro a basso prezzo in quelle condizioni un rischio straordinario specialmente nei paesi nordici e specialmente tra i ghiacci
italian come potr cavarsela una persona che usa i pantaloni corti che non ha un briciolo di competenza a trenta gradi sotto zero e con uno strato di ghiaccio di tre metri
italian e un problema che va affrontato
italian il personale di volo viene sempre ben istruito ma lo stesso non si pu dire della forza lavoro a buon mercato che lavora sulle navi
italian aspetto l intervento della commissione in questa questione
italian signor presidente anche io voglio congratularmi con la onorevole peijs per la sua valida relazione
italian il traffico europeo presenta molti problemi e difficolt le linee terrestri e gli spazi aerei sono congestionati e le linee ferroviarie non sono competitive
italian questa settimana qui in parlamento ci sono state molte relazioni importanti concernenti i trasporti tutte miranti ad eliminare la congestione dei traffici ed a diminuire le difficolt
italian l ottima relazione della onorevole peijs mira a sfruttare le possibilit offerte dal trasporto marittimo a corto raggio ed un importante compendio alle relazioni sul traffico aereo e quello ferroviario
italian abbiamo proprio bisogno di catene logistiche funzionanti e competitive che colleghino il trasporto stradale ferroviario e marittimo a corto raggio e anche la moderna tecnologia dell informazione
italian per i paesi di confine e separati dal mare tra cui la finlandia il trasporto marittimo a corto raggio una vera e propria necessit vitale come ha constatato un attimo fa l onorevole paasilinna
italian voglio ancora sottolineare l adeguatezza e la disponibilit dei porti e dei servizi portuali
italian i porti devono essere inseriti nelle grandi reti europee come parte della struttura di base dei trasporti
italian l attuazione delle misure proposte nella relazione presuppone un contributo effettivo allo sviluppo del trasporto marittimo a corto raggio nonche una buona cooperazione da parte dell unione degli stati membri anche a livello locale e inoltre delle aziende
italian signor presidente voglio innanzitutto esprimere il mio ringraziamento alla relatrice la quale con tutta evidenza ha dedicato a questa ottima relazione molto tempo portando alla luce una cospicua serie di questioni
italian a seconda del luogo da cui li si guarda i problemi appaiono assai differenti tra loro poiche ogni regione dell unione europea ha le proprie particolari difficolt da affrontare
italian dobbiamo riconoscere che ci vorr un certo tempo per raggiungere l obiettivo finale ma non c dubbio che nostro dovere cercare di promuovere il traffico marittimo a corto raggio ben pi di quanto abbiamo fatto finora
italian e certamente sensato trasportare una maggior quantit di merci via mare piuttosto che su gomma essendo tale modalit di trasporto maggiormente compatibile con l ambiente e pi vantaggiosa da ogni punto di vista
italian dobbiamo per essere certi di ottenere il giusto equilibrio e proprio su questo punto la relatrice ha insistito
italian tra i maggiori problemi da affrontare vi sar sempre quello dell incidenza dei costi
italian per essere competitivi i porti devono essere pi efficienti e per essere tali avranno certamente bisogno di maggiore sostegno
italian appoggio la richiesta della onorevole attwooll in merito all autostrada a
italian essa prende atto che nell irlanda del nord l esportazione di merci deve misurarsi con i costi molto elevati dell attraversamento del tratto di mare che separa l irlanda del nord dalla scozia la regione verso la quale si dirigono gran parte dei nostri prodotti e dalla quale essi raggiungono poi l inghilterra
italian quel servizio di trasporto pu certamente essere effettuato in modo pi efficiente ed ecologicamente sostenibile ma non in modo pi economico
italian perche le nostre industrie e l agricoltura possano sopravvivere deve esserci un rapporto vantaggioso tra costi e benefici
italian fino a qualche tempo fa i collegamenti tra ballycastle e la scozia meridionale erano garantiti da un ottimo servizio di traghetti che per stato costretto a cessare l attivit a causa della mancanza di sostegno e della burocrazia
italian signor presidente signora relatrice vorrei innanzitutto congratularmi con lei per la qualit della relazione da lei presentata
italian i colleghi intervenuti finora hanno tutti ricordato come lei che il trasporto marittimo a corto raggio gode purtroppo di un immagine negativa a causa della sua lentezza o della sua inefficacia mentre offre una risposta al problema della congestione del traffico dell elevato costo delle infrastrutture e dell inquinamento
italian d altra parte questa modalit di trasporto ha registrato negli ultimi anni un indiscutibile successo benche poco nota e ancora carente
italian ma come ha detto lei il trasporto marittimo a corto raggio presenta vantaggi in termini di costi di energia di efficienza di coesione regionale di ambiente e persino di intermodalit essendo un mezzo ideale per la realizzazione di trasporti multimodali
italian vanno quindi prese rapidamente misure finalizzate ad ottimizzare le operazioni portuali nonche a ridurre i tempi di attesa nei porti
italian insisto personalmente affinche il settore pubblico svolga il ruolo che gli compete sia a livello regionale che nazionale ed europeo
italian nella sua relazione tuttavia vi sono due punti che mi lasciano perplesso
italian prima di tutto la proposta di compilare un elenco dei porti particolarmente adatti al trasporto marittimo a corto raggio
italian non mi sembra necessario in quanto si rischia di penalizzare quelli che oggi non sono ancora del tutto adeguati ma che potranno attrezzarsi per il futuro
italian si suggerisce peraltro anche di centralizzare in un unico punto l offerta di servizi logistici di trasporto agli utenti finali
italian sono senz altro favorevole ad un sistema informativo ma sono personalmente contrario all idea che un grande porto gi in posizione di forza diventi il catalizzatore di tutti i servizi
italian infine come membro della commissione per l industria il commercio estero la ricerca e l energia avrei auspicato che si dichiarasse apertamente che il trasporto marittimo a corto raggio non deve essere considerato un alternativa ma che sarebbe necessaria una strategia intermodale che renda complementari le diverse forme di trasporto
italian in quest ottica e in un simile contesto gli stati membri dovrebbero del resto armonizzare le relative regolamentazioni specie per il trasporto terrestre che spesso provoca in termini di distorsioni delle interruzioni nella catena del sistema dei trasporti
italian se si vuole realizzare un sistema davvero intermodale essenziale disporre di un insieme di mezzi di trasporto e di regole che sia non tanto necessariamente comune quanto perlomeno perfettamente armonizzato
italian en signor presidente mi si consenta di ringraziare la onorevole peijs per l eccellente relazione e per l impegno profuso nell elaborarla
italian la relazione dimostra che il traffico marittimo a corto raggio un tema sul quale vi un ampio accordo tra il parlamento gli stati membri e la commissione e che tale accordo non si limita alle nostre istituzioni
italian non ho notizia infatti di alcuna organizzazione o persona che non desideri lo sviluppo del traffico marittimo a corto raggio
italian in passato abbiamo colpevolmente sottovalutato il settore in questione
italian facendo menzione del suo potenziale abbiamo implicitamente affermato che esso non versa in una situazione positiva quando invece sta agendo al meglio
italian pur non essendo stato pubblicizzato a dovere tuttavia un dato di fatto che il trasporto marittimo a corto raggio stato l unica modalit di trasporto che nel corso degli anni novanta ha dimostrato di essere in grado di reggere il passo con lo sviluppo del trasporto su strada
italian dobbiamo perci dare credito a questo settore anche se c sempre spazio per ulteriori miglioramenti e il settore marittimo il primo ad ammetterlo
italian mi si consenta ora di fare riferimento ad alcuni punti della relazione della onorevole peijs
italian dobbiamo adottare un impostazione globale per rendere tale modalit di trasporto un effettivo servizio porta a porta
italian esso deve diventare parte integrante della catena di trasporto ed essere offerto con una logistica centralizzata
italian alcune strozzature inibiscono ancora lo sviluppo del traffico a corto raggio
italian i servizi della commissione in collaborazione con i nuovi stati membri e con l industria del settore stanno operando per localizzare tali strozzature insieme con le possibili soluzioni
italian un area gi individuata rappresentata dalla diversit dei documenti richiesti
italian in modo da raggiungere una maggiore uniformit la commissione intende presentare entro la fine del corrente anno una proposta finalizzata ad armonizzare una serie di documenti marittimi di arrivo e partenza
italian l efficienza dei porti essenziale per questo tipo di trasporto e al riguardo sempre entro la fine dell anno la commissione presenter un pacchetto di misure volte a migliorare l efficienza per mezzo di un processo di liberalizzazione
italian e poi necessario aggiornare l immagine ormai obsoleta di questo tipo di traffico marittimo
italian la questione gi stata menzionata nel corso della presente discussione e al riguardo esprimo tutto il mio apprezzamento
italian la presenza di uffici nazionali per la promozione del trasporto a corto raggio assume un ruolo fondamentale nell attuazione della politica in materia
italian alcuni di questi uffici gi esistono e la commissione intende incoraggiarne l ulteriore diffusione in modo da formare una rete europea di promozione
italian nel corso della discussione stata sollevata la questione degli aiuti comunitari e voglio cogliere l opportunit per fornire qui una risposta
italian la fonte principale degli aiuti comunitari al settore del trasporto marittimo a corto raggio stata in passato il programma pact che consiste in un azione pilota a favore del trasporto combinato
italian lo scorso anno il percento circa della dotazione pact pari a milioni di euro stata utilizzata a favore del trasporto marittimo a corto raggio combinato
italian nel tale quota aumenter nostra intenzione infatti portarla al percento
italian la direzione generale competente intende mantenere questa linea d azione in modo che il trasporto marittimo a corto raggio continui a fruire della giusta quota della dotazione pact
italian in occasione dell imminente revisione del programma si potrebbe anche arrivare ad incorporare tale principio nel testo ufficiale
italian l onorevole purvis mi ha chiesto di trasmettere il suo invito alla mia collega commissario signora de palacio
italian lo far senz altro e la signora apprezzer certamente la prospettiva di una romantica gita in scozia che peraltro sarebbe ancora pi romantica se l onorevole purvis volesse cedere a me il piacere di accompagnare il commissario de palacio
italian onorevole peijs la ringrazio per il lavoro svolto e per avere confermato che tutti ci stiamo muovendo nella stessa direzione
italian auspico che si possa agire in un clima di collaborazione e garantisco che la commissione far del proprio meglio
italian signor presidente desidero esprimere il mio disappunto in merito ad una questione gi oggetto di un interrogazione scritta alla commissione da me presentata pi di sei mesi fa che ho riproposto nel corso della discussione e sulla quale non ho ancora ricevuto alcun segnale tanto meno una risposta
italian la ringrazio onorevole maccormick
italian la votazione si svolger domani venerd alle
italian dialogo civile
italian l ordine del giorno reca l interrogazione orale alla commissione b a nome della commissione per l occupazione e gli affari sociali sul futuro finanziamento del dialogo civile
italian ha facolt di parlare l onorevole pronk
italian signor presidente mi auguro che a quest ora tarda non avremo bisogno di molto tempo
italian e un peccato che dobbiamo concludere questa discussione di per se assai importante
italian se mi consentito cogliere l occasione penso che forse sarebbe opportuno se in futuro il marted non decidessimo di introdurre il marted sera un ulteriore tornata di votazioni in modo da non incorrere in ulteriori ritardi nel corso della settimana
italian forse sarebbe bene che lei presentasse questa proposta all ufficio di presidenza
italian naturalmente ci non ha nulla a che fare con tali problemi
italian non c bisogno che mi dilunghi in molte spiegazioni
italian in primo luogo indubbio che le organizzazioni non governative svolgono un ruolo estremamente importante sia negli stati membri sia nell unione europea sia al di fuori di essa
italian tutti sono d accordo su questo lo ha detto il consiglio lo ha affermato pi volte la commissione e anche il parlamento lo ha ribadito in pi occasioni
italian inoltre all articolo se associato alle dichiarazioni e il trattato sottolinea che ci dev essere collaborazione con in particolare i wohlfahrtsverband che ovviamente sono anche ong
italian il parlamento europeo lo ha sempre fatto e a tale fine ha creato gi parecchio tempo fa una linea di bilanci la b per rendere possibile il finanziamento delle ong
italian per in seguito alle diverse disposizioni concordate con il consiglio e alle sentenze della corte di giustizia dopo circa tre anni la suddetta linea si praticamente esaurita
italian gi da tre anni commissione sapeva che ci sarebbe accaduto
italian non questo il problema bens il fatto che si faccia cos poco
italian da un lato vediamo grande interesse dall altro notiamo relativamente poche azioni concrete ad eccezione del documento elaborato dalla commissione che noi richiediamo a gran voce
italian il punto come riuscire a tradurre in realt le belle idee espresse
italian a ci si aggiungono spess non lo dico a nome della commissione ma a titolo personal problemi di carattere burocratico
italian e possibile che ci sia dovuto al fatto che sono coinvolte diverse direzioni generali della commissione
italian le ong non ricadono sotto un unica dg
italian e possibile che si cerchi un ottica comune e che allo stesso tempo si vogliano individuare delle ottiche specifiche ma ad ogni modo ci richiede troppo tempo perche le linee di bilancio si esauriscono
italian questo il motivo per cui stasera a quest ora di per se inopportuna richiamiamo l attenzione della commissione su questo problema
italian in particolare si tratta di una questione di velocit non si tratta dell intento della commissione ma della velocit alla quale possibile realizzare i diversi obiettivi poiche altrimenti rischiamo che sia uno dei compiti chiave affidatoci dal trattato nelle dichiarazioni sia quanto ribadito nell ambito del vertice di feira non possano essere attuati per il fatto che le ong o almeno la maggior parte di ess questo l unico problema sono estremamente vulnerabili per quanto riguarda le interruzioni nei pagamenti lo sono molto di pi rispetto ad altre organizzazioni e certamente agli stati membri
italian ci significa che se si aspetta troppo esse sono destinate a morte sicura
italian questa la grande preoccupazione che serpeggia nella commissione ed il motivo per cui poniamo i quesiti in oggetto e per cui ci auguriamo che la commissione affronti in tempi rapidi il problema nel quadro delle possibilit offerte dal trattato e nel quadro del clima di globale disponibilit che il consiglio ha fatto trasparire a feira che il parlamento ha percepito e che la commissione ha fatto vedere
italian signor presidente sar telegrafico
italian ritengo che la risposta del signor commissario sia di per se incoraggiante
italian penso che in effetti il parlamento debba fare del suo meglio per non ostacolare le procedure
italian devo per rilevare che il parlamento con le possibilit che gli si offrivano soprattutto sotto il profilo finanziario ha fatto del suo meglio per mantenere le linee di bilancio che consentivano di continuare a finanziare le ong solo che a partire da un certo momento ci non pi possibile e pertanto acquista grande rilevanza la velocit
italian un ultima osservazione in relazione alla risposta ufficiale del commissario in merito alla conferenza intergovernativa
italian non si tratta tanto del contenuto dell attuale trattato o delle attuali dichiarazioni bens di elaborare le dichiarazioni in modo da poter creare una base giuridica sulla quale fondare un programma
italian questo il vero problema e chiedo al signor commissario se la commissione possa rivolgere l attenzione su questo aspetto
italian non chiediamo quindi un nuovo trattato ma maggiore attenzione
italian infine in considerazione del fatto che anche nel quadro dell ampliamento dobbiamo affrontare il tema dello sviluppo delle ong nei nuovi stati membri riteniamo che a tale problematica debba essere riservata la massima priorit
italian signor presidente intervengo a nome del gruppo socialista a sostegno di quanto ha espresso l onorevole pronk a nome di tutta la commissione
italian devo dire riferendomi alle risposte del commissario che non mi hanno del tutto soddisfatto nel senso che i documenti cui si fatto riferimento li conosciamo per come diceva l onorevole pronk ci vuole tempestivit e forse un po pi di decisione nella concretezza
italian sappiamo che da anni esiste un colloquio
italian noi come parlamento abbiamo avuto un ruolo fondamentale in questo pero ora dai colloqui e dalle dichiarazioni occorre passare agli atti concreti
italian io credo che la commissione debba muoversi nella direzione di proporre delle soluzioni concrete perche altrimenti questo problema non si risolve
italian trovo anche una certa contraddizione e provo una certa preoccupazione che non solo mia ma credo anche della commissione per l occupazione e gli affari sociali perche mi sembra che i comportamenti della commissione siano un po contraddittori fra di loro
italian il ruolo delle organizzazioni non governative nel processo di costruzione democratica dell unione e il ruolo anche sul piano economico e sociale che esse svolgono in europa tutto il settore dell economia sociale del terzo settore ormai riconosciuto non solo nei documenti ma nella concreta realt se teniamo conto che circa nove milioni di lavoratori sono occupati in questo settor come un settore fondamentale e importante
italian ebbene la commissione nelle sue ultime scelt mi riferisco alla direzione generale industri ritiene che questa sia una priorit negativ ora hanno inventato le priorit positive e negativ e ha soppresso l unit operativa economia sociale
italian bene io credo che questo sia gravissimo e non ci fa ben sperare che le dichiarazioni che qui vengono riaffermate che abbiamo sentito pi volte portino poi a degli atti concreti nella direzione contraria
italian la piattaforma delle ong strumento con cui la commissione e il parlamento hanno mantenuto un colloquio tutto questo mondo si sente un po preso in giro e credo che anche noi parlamentari ci sentiamo un po presi in giro quando le dichiarazioni vanno in una certa direzione e poi le decisioni concrete vanno in un altra
italian la mancanza di un interlocutore anche dal punto di vista funzionariale render pi difficile la soluzione di questi problemi invece di renderli pi facili
italian allora se davvero vogliamo affrontarli in senso positivo accelerare le procedure e dare delle risposte positive non solo alle organizzazioni non governative ma ai cittadini europei credo che occorrerebbe ripensare tutta una serie di decisioni e ritornare soprattutto su una serie di decisioni
italian signor presidente molti di noi nel gruppo verde alleanza libera europea hanno cominciato la propria attivit aderendo al movimento delle organizzazioni non governative e a quello attivista si tratta quindi di un mondo a noi molto caro
italian proprio oggi abbiamo discusso sulla relazione annuale della commissione per le petizioni ovvero di quella parte relativa alle doglianze che concorre a formare il processo di valutazione di ci che accade nell unione europea
italian le ong dal nostro punto di vista agiscono come una parte del processo di prevenzione e costituiscono un meccanismo di indagine un modo per accertare che non vadano perduti taluni aspetti delle norme che andiamo elaborando
italian esse ci portano a considerare elementi di novit e sono fondamentali nel processo di cui noi siamo parte oltre ad essere tra le poche organizzazioni che agiscono davvero per conto dei cittadini se intendiamo davvero creare un clima di fiducia entro le strutture che cerchiamo di costruire il loro ruolo certamente essenziale
italian un elemento di indubbia importanza riguarda il fatto che le ong possono controbilanciare i tanti interessi economici che non sembrano avere difficolt finanziarie a trovare una strada che conduca alla nostra porta mentre per molte ong l azione a livello internazionale enormemente costosa
italian il lavoro svolto dalle varie commissioni nel corso delle ultime settimane sull articolo quello contro la discriminazione sarebbe stato impossibile senza la collaborazione di questi soggetti
italian e quindi essenziale e necessario definire con chiarezza una base giuridica per la partecipazione e il finanziamento delle ong perche senza di esse la nostra istituzione non pu funzionare
italian si parlato dei paesi candidati e non posso che ripetere le parole del mio collega onorevole pronk e riaffermare che il movimento costituito dalle ong e dalla societ civile in quei paesi sar fondamentale per realizzare un unione europea costruita sui valori della giustizia e della democrazia
italian voglio infine insistere sul fatto che si debba trovare una via per creare un meccanismo serio e affidabile di finanziamento almeno a favore delle organizzazioni che rappresentano i cittadini poveri esclusi e discriminati in modo che esse non debbano affannarsi ogni anno a reperire finanziamenti senza sapere se riusciranno a sopravvivere e a proseguire l opera per la quale sono state istituite
italian signor presidente negli ultimi anni l unione ha ricevuto sempre pi importanti competenze in materia sociale per non ha avuto a disposizione fondi corrispondenti per risolvere i problemi di natura sociale
italian fintantoche gli stati membri riterranno che le questioni sociali rappresentino una competenza sostanzialmente nazionale questo stato di cose non cambier in tempi rapidi
italian sappiamo che i fondi disponibili sono strettamente legati al bilancio e che operare storni non facile
italian e sino a quando questa sar la concezione degli stati membri sar molto difficile soddisfare nuove esigenze
italian per tali ragioni ritengo della massima importanza per noi che lavoriamo in seno alle istituzioni comunitarie riconoscere alle organizzazioni non governative che operano in ambito sociale in europa molta pi importanza di quanto accade ora
italian tutti riconosciamo la necessit di azioni transfrontaliere anche in ambito sociale
italian ecco perche vi spazio per le ong
italian ma sarebbe del tutto infelice ed forse proprio questa l intenzione degli stati membri se le ong divenissero economicamente dipendenti dall ue e politicamente del tutto vincolate a quest ancor pi di quanto non stia gi accadendo
italian il loro valore risiede proprio nel loro carattere volontario e civico e nella capacit di vedere i problemi sociali in un altra prospettiva rispetto alle autorit ci consente alle ong di fungere da complemento da alternativa rispetto a commissione consiglio e parlamento
italian nonostante siano in pochi ad ascoltar vedo che i parlamentari in aula sono circa sei soltant vorrei presentare una proposta
italian propongo che la commissione si dia da fare per istituire un fondo europeo finalizzato proprio alle ong operanti in ambito sociale
italian propongo che la commissione interpelli il consiglio e gli stati membri nel tentativo di ottenere un contributo per tale fondo
italian dovrebbe trattarsi di un fondo creato a titolo di organismo indipendente con un consiglio di amministrazione composto da persone provenienti dalle organizzazioni sociali stesse da ricercatori e da esperti di questioni sociale
italian si potrebbe ipotizzare che una simile organizzazione possa sottrarsi a una parte dei problemi connessi alla burocrazia
italian il controllo economico avverrebbe a cura di revisori professionisti
italian credo che se tale sfida verr raccolta con una certa finezza diplomatica gli stati membri reagiranno positivamente alla proposta
italian e credo ancora che le altre parti sia i soggetti socialmente penalizzati sia le ong sia gli stai membri sia le istituzioni dell unione si rallegrerebbero enormemente della creazione di un simile fondo
italian signor presidente concordo con quanto hanno affermato le onorevoli lambert e ghilardotti
italian le ong europee attive in campo sociale hanno assunto un ruolo essenziale per il lavoro del parlamento
italian chiunque abbia partecipato all elaborazione del pacchetto contro la discriminazione ovvero l articolo se ne reso ben conto
italian a partire dalla crisi di bilancio del a causa della quale sono stati congelati i fondi destinati all azione delle ong a favore dei cittadini pi deboli in europa e nei paesi in via di sviluppo sono stati fatti molti progressi
italian la presidenza portoghese ha avviato un nuovo corso invitando la piattaforma europea delle ong al vertice informale di lisbona in materia di affari sociali e la presidenza francese sta percorrendo la stessa via
italian le conclusioni del vertice di lisbona contengono un esplicito riferimento a questo genere di iniziative
italian ma le parole non bastano e le difficolt due anni dopo la crisi del non sono affatto scomparse
italian dopo un biennio di consultazioni con le ong la commissione stata in grado solo di produrre un documento di riflessione e di costituire due gruppi interni di lavoro che hanno lavorato assai poco
italian nel frattempo il settore delle ong in cui io stesso ho avuto modo di lavorare sta soffocando a causa di norme burocratiche che introdotte per promuovere la trasparenza e la responsabilit alla fine hanno creato soltanto ulteriori oneri burocratici
italian anche la nostra assemblea signor presidente contribuisce a complicare la situazione gi difficile delle ong approvando complesse norme in materia di requisiti di cofinanziamento a cui si accompagnano scadenze strettissime
italian l unica linea di bilancio a disposizione la b stata smantellata e la commissione non ha prodotto alcuna proposta finalizzata a stabilire una base giuridica per il dialogo civile per mezzo di un regolamento del consiglio o di un articolo del trattato
italian ma quel che peggio alle ong attive in campo sociale la commissione ha comunicato che il finanziamento a loro favore dovr utilizzare le nuove linee di bilancio dedicate alla lotta alla discriminazione e all esclusione sociale
italian ma come sar possibile farlo se i fondi a disposizione per quei programmi sono stati ridotti oltre ogni misura ragionevole
italian molte ong la cui azione in campo sociale preziosa devono fronteggiare una situazione di grave crisi a causa dell inerzia della commissione e del consiglio
italian conosco il caso di una ong che ha richiesto il finanziamento su alcuni progetti per i quali era necessario presentare ottanta pagine di documenti di bilancio e un tale numero di documenti di supporto che la domanda di finanziamento alla fine pesava oltre dodici chilogrammi
italian questa situazione deve mutare signor presidente
italian le ong sono fondamentali per il nostro lavoro e noi abbiamo il dovere di sostenerle
italian ringrazio tutti gli onorevoli deputati che sono intervenuti nella discussione per le loro osservazioni anche per quelle negative
italian sar mia cura inoltrarle a chi di dovere e iscriverle nell agenda della commissione
italian risponder ora brevemente a due sole osservazioni
italian la prima riguarda le basi giuridiche e il finanziamento
italian non va dimenticato che l elemento distintivo delle organizzazioni non governative che esse non dovrebbero dipendere da finanziamenti pubblici che altrimenti non potrebbero chiamarsi organizzazioni non governative bens dovrebbero chiamarsi organizzazioni governative
italian mi riesce pertanto difficile comprendere la richiesta espressa pi volte secondo cui dovrebbero essere i governi o la commissione ad assicurare integralmente il finanziamento delle ong
italian no ci possono essere solo e soltanto forme di sostegno e di collaborazione ai progetti
italian un tanto per mettere in chiaro una questione di principio
italian la seconda osservazione si riferisce ad un punto che stato affrontato ripetutamente ossia le ong e l allargamento
italian desidero rispondere perche questa materia rientra nelle mie competenze dirette
italian tutte le proposte che sono state formulate in proposito durante la discussione odierna sono divenute realt gi da lungo tempo
italian nell ambito degli aiuti di preadesione siamo fortemente impegnati nella collaborazione con le ong dei paesi candidati mentre la strategia di comunicazione il cui quadro organizzativo e finanziario stato nel frattempo precisato rivolta anch essa in modo particolare alle ong di detti paesi poiche l obiettivo esattamente quello di coinvolgere appieno la societ civile in questo importante processo politico
italian riporter fedelmente alla commissione tutte le altre osservazioni fatte oggi dalle quali se ho bene interpretato emerge un atteggiamento di fondo negativo vi posso ad ogni modo garantire che io stesso mi dar da fare con grande impegno affinche le procedure siano semplificate e le decisioni siano accelerate
italian vi ringrazio onorevoli colleghi

french en une proportion assez elevee de plaintes environ qui depassaient le cadre du mandat du mediateur europeen nous sont encore parvenues
french la proportion de plaintes depassant le cadre du mandat a m me leg rement augmente probablement en raison du fait que nous en avons re u un nombre croissant par courrier electronique
french nous sommes heureux d accepter des plaintes par courrier electronique et beaucoup d entre elles contiennent des allegations bien presentees de mauvaise administration
french toutefois la plus grande partie de ce type de plaintes est dirigee contre les autorites des etats membres
french l annee derni re lors de la campagne en vue de l election du mediateur europeen certaines voix critiques ont suggere que le mandat du mediateur devrait tre elargi afin d y inclure des plaintes formulees l encontre d etats membres dans les cas o interviendrait la legislation de l union europeenne
french je ne suis pas s r qu elles aient compris que cela signifiait pour le mediateur effectuer des t ches relevant actuellement de la commission europeenne en tant que gardienne des traites et du parlement europeen en tant que forum democratique auquel les citoyens peuvent adresser des petitions
french nous etudions minutieusement toutes les plaintes que nous recevons en particulier si celles ci impliquent des droits dans le cadre de la legislation de l union europeenne
french en nous sommes parvenus conseiller le plaignant ou transferer la plainte vers un organisme competent et ce pour la moitie des cas environ
french parmi ces cas nous en avons transfere au parlement europeen et qui doivent tre traites en tant que petitions et nous avons informe autres plaignants de leur droit deposer une petition au parlement europeen
french dans de nombreux cas des plaintes conte les autorites nationales regionales ou locales pourraient tre traitees efficacement par un mediateur au sein de l etat membre concerne
french il devrait exister dans chaque etat membre un organisme non judiciaire qui puisse aider les citoyens europeens dans des conflits avec l administration d un etat membre qui touchent leurs droits dans le cadre de la legislation de l union europeenne
french en tant que defenseur de la subsidiarite je demeure convaincu que la mani re la plus efficace d atteindre cet objectif est de developper un reseau de cooperation entre ces mediateurs l instar des organismes tels que les commissions des petitions
french nous avons conjointement organise avec le mediateur fran ais m stasi un seminaire pour les mediateurs nationaux et les organismes homologues
french a paris en septembre m perry le premier vice president de la commission des petitions a represente le parlement europeen
french un seminaire supplementaire est prevu bruxelles sous la presidence belge du conseil en en collaboration avec la commission et les mediateurs belges federaux et regionaux
french les mediateurs regionaux et organismes homologues ont ete invites l annee derni re une reunion florence laquelle m gemelli president de la commission des petition a egalement participe
french les mediateurs regionaux et les organismes homologues seront egalement invites bruxelles l annee prochaine
french les mediateurs et organismes homologues au sein des etats membres ont fait preuve d une attitude positive vis vis de la collaboration avec le mediateur europeen
french je crois fermement que la collaboration en termes equitables avec ces derniers produira les meilleurs resultats pour les citoyens europeens
french d s le depart des doutes importants ont ete emis quant au fait que le mediateur europeen dispose ou non de suffisamment de pouvoirs en vue de produire de quelconques resultats pour les citoyens
french ces doutes n etaient pas justifies parce que les institutions et organes de la communaute ont correctement repondu au travail du mediateur
french d s l abord ils ont eux m mes trouve une solution des plaintes dans plus de cas la satisfaction des plaignants
french ils ont par exemple repondu des lettres restees sans reponse effectue des paiements en souffrance et inverse des decisions defavorables
french cela indique un esprit de repondant et de flexibilite superieur celui des administrations nationales dont j ai eu l experience
french de ces r glements ont eu lieu l annee derni re reduisant de ce fait le champ des solutions l amiable proposer par le mediateur
french toutefois nous avons trouve une solution l amiable en en effet la commission et le conseil se sont accordes sur le fait que le plaignant devrait se voir verser la somme due pour son travail en tant que coordinateur regional pour l union europeenne de la surveillance des elections palestiniennes
french si l institution ou l organisme concernes ne corrigent pas les actes de mauvaise administration de leur propre chef l arme ultime du mediateur est le projet de recommandation suivi si necessaire par un rapport special au parlement europeen
french il y a cinq ans il se trouvait beaucoup de personnes pour dire que les institutions et organismes europeens faisaient peu de cas du parlement europeen
french m me si l epoque ils avaient raison les choses ont clairement change depuis le traite d amsterdam et la chute de la commission santer
french nous avons redige en dix projets de recommandation
french dans sept cas l institution concernee a accepte un projet de recommandation
french par deux fois le mediateur a redige un rapport special au parlement europeen
french il y a encore un cas en cours etant donne qu europol a besoin de temps supplementaire pour se conformer au projet de recommandation selon lequel il devrait permettre au public un certain acc s des documents
french je crois que les activites du mediateur europeen ont atteint le niveau qu on est en droit d attendre d un nouvel organisme constitue de personnes travaillant au sein d un environnement juridique assez complexe
french nous produisons des resultats en faveur des citoyens europeens et c est ce qui compte avant tout
french je voudrais saisir l occasion et remercier toutes les institutions et organismes de la communaute pour une annee supplementaire de collaboration constructive
french je voudrais en particulier adresser mes remerciements la commission et son membre responsable mme loyola de palacio pour avoir poursuivi l engagement de son predecesseur en vue d une collaboration honn te et constructive avec le mediateur
french je voudrais egalement dire que j apprecie sinc rement l attitude utile et cooperative envers le bureau du mediateur dont a fait preuve la commission des petitions et en particulier son vice president m gemelli je voudrais en outre remercier le rapporteur de la commission des petitions mme thors pour son important travail l occasion de son rapport exhaustif
french je vous remercie pour votre attention
french monsieur le president c est effectivement un rapport en deux volets que je presente ce matin un rapport qui refl te le travail de la commission elle m me et le travail du bureau de mme banotti mediateur du parlement pour les enl vements internationaux d enfants
french je voudrais egalement exprimer mon appreciation personnelle du travail effectue par le mediateur m s derman
french mes remerciements vont egalement au secretariat de la commission notamment pour les details statistiques fournis dans le rapport qui je dois l avouer ne proviennent pas de mon propre travail
french j invite instamment les deputes qui ne sont pas familiarises avec la commission des petitions lire ces rapports
french cela pourrait leur tre utile dans les services qu ils fournissent aux personnes qu ils representent
french je voudrais egalement attirer leur attention sur le site web mentionne et cree dans le cadre de l initiative europe direct qui pourrait fournir des informations utiles et eviter le cas echeant la necessite de deposer une petition ou confirmer le fait qu elle constitue un moyen approprie
french ces informations sont de plus en plus necessaires mesure que le public prend conscience de l importance et de la pertinence du niveau de l union europeenne
french l objectif de la commission des petitions elle m me est de fournir un service de qualite et efficace aux personnes au sein de l union europeenne et la societe civile en general
french tout individu citoyen resident ou groupe peut deposer une petition au parlement s il estime que la legislation ou les principes communautaires ne sont pas mis en x uvre correctement quel que soit le niveau
french l annee derni re nous avons re u petitions dont ont ete considerees comme recevables
french je n en mentionnerai que deux afin de demontrer l eventail des th mes et l efficacite potentielle du mecanisme
french il y avait le cas d une petitionnaire britannique qui a reussi faire reconna tre par les autorites fran aises ses annees d experience en tant qu enseignante ce qui affecte probablement ses perspectives salariales et de promotion
french le deuxi me cas a trait une petition deposee par un citoyen espagnol membre d une association ecologique qui a donne lieu une procedure d infraction contre les autorites espagnoles dans le cadre de la directive habitats une cause frequente de plainte la directive pas les autorites ayant des repercussions nationales durables
french ce sont ces types de cas qui fournissent des informations utiles en retour au parlement europeen et aux autres institutions sur la mani re dont s applique la legislation au benefice des personnes et de la societe ou sur la mani re dont elle ne s applique pas le cas echeant
french nous ne pourrions travailler efficacement au sein de cette commission sans le soutien de nombreux fonctionnaires de la commission qui enqu tent et entament des procedures si necessaire
french je souhaite exprimer nos remerciements
french je sais que nous pourrions fournir un service plus rapide et plus efficace si les etats membres pouvaient repondre de mani re tout aussi engagee aux demandes d information et d explication
french nous traitons actuellement un cas pour lequel il a fallu quatorze mois avant d obtenir une reponse une lettre
french ce n est pas inhabituel
french c est la raison pour laquelle nous recommandons que le conseil ou une representation permanente pertinente participe egalement nos reunions afin qu ils acqui rent une comprehension accrue des probl mes auxquels les citoyens sont confrontes et qu ils y repondent efficacement
french j attirerais l attention du conseil sur les points et du rapport s il etait represente
french l objectif de la commission est d ameliorer la qualite generale de nos mecanismes d information de retour
french certaines de nos idees sont mentionnees dans ce rapport
french d autres figureront dans un prochain rapport publie au mois de septembre et redige par mm
french perry et ke ler nous proposons comme nous l avons fait l annee derni re une banque de donnees afin que les petitionnaires et les deputes puissent suivre l evolution des rapports et identifier les probl mes
french nous esperons que les autorites competentes garderont cela l esprit cette annee et se conformeront la proposition
french il y a de nombreux points concernant nos relations avec les autres commissions
french nous leur demandons de faire appel plus souvent la commission des petitions en vue d exprimer des opinions dans certains domaines faisant l objet de preoccupation
french nous voudrions tre associes la preparation de rapports communs dans des domaines qui font l objet de preoccupations particuli res tels que l environnement la securite sociale la protection des consommateurs etc
french nous souhaiterions egalement faire usage de l experience des membres de notre commission acquise gr ce leur travail dans d autres commissions du parlement en vue d etablir un syst me faisant intervenir des rapporteurs pour des th mes specifiques
french nous sommes egalement desireux d etablir des liens avec les commissions des petitions dans d autres etats membres en vue d echanger des bonnes idees et la fa on de comprendre les probl mes
french en tant que commission nous considerons que les petitions constituent un outil utile et qui renforce la democratie dans une institution qui peut parfois sembler lointaine et anonyme
french nous devons apprecier ce mecanisme et utiliser l experience des personnes que nous representons experience exprimee travers leurs petitions en vue d ameliorer globalement notre travail
french je recommande ce rapport l assemblee
french monsieur le president madame la commissaire et monsieur le mediateur europeen l opinion des rapporteurs et de la commission sur le rapport du mediateur europeen pour annee qui s est caracterisee par des crises au sein des institutions europeennes et par une profonde mefiance vis vis de l administration est que les citoyens ne trouveront une justification reelle l integration europeenne que s ils jouissent de droits leur permettant de participer activement un dialogue politique avec les institutions
french le dialogue politique n est cependant pas un veritable dialogue si les citoyens ne disposent pas du droit l information et de l acc s aux documents qu ils reclament si les avis qu ils expriment ne sont pas pris en consideration traites et pris au serieux
french quel est le rapport avec la mission du mediateur europeen
french la mission du mediateur est en vertu des traites de mener des enqu tes sur des cas de mauvaise administration au sein des institutions ou organes communautaires
french la demande du parlement europeen le mediateur a donne une definition du terme mauvaise administration dans le rapport annuel de
french celle ci s applique lorsqu un organisme public n agit pas en conformite avec une r gle ou un principe ayant pour lui force de loi
french les institutions se sont mises d accord au cours du precedent mandat du mediateur pour appliquer cette definition qui constitue maintenant et pour l avenir le point de depart des activites du mediateur
french la commission souligne dans le rapport que cette definition approuvee en commun de mauvaise administration implique egalement le droit d examiner la mani re dont les institutions interpr tent le droit communautaire
french quelle que soit la forme juridique que rev tira la charte des droits fondamentaux elle sera en tout cas une expression des traditions constitutionnelles communes des etats membres qui selon l article du traite doivent tre respectees par l union et par consequent par les institutions et les organes
french la commission etablit d s lors que le mediateur europeen doit assumer un r le important dans l application d une future charte des droits fondamentaux des citoyens
french la commission a egalement clairement exprime son soutien pour qu une charte des droits fondamentaux contienne des normes octroyant aux citoyens le droit une bonne administration au sein de l ue
french bonne administration s oppose mauvaise administration
french le droit une bonne administration au niveau de la charte des droits des citoyens et du code de bonne conduite administrative dont le parlement et le mediateur europeen font la publicite implique notamment le droit d tre entendu dans son affaire le droit de consulter des documents le droit une reponse rapide de la part de l administration et une reponse motivee
french tous ces aspects ont ete au centre du travail du mediateur
french ces droits sont autant de conditions indispensables une citoyennete active qui est necessaire si l ue veut regagner la confiance des citoyens
french ce sont ces droits qui rendent la citoyennete active plut t que passive
french une bonne administration peut creer les conditions indispensables une citoyennete active tandis qu une mauvaise administration peut ebranler les conditions de celle ci
french quelles sont les types de plaintes les plus courants adresses au mediateur europeen
french des informations incompl tes ou le refus d informations le retard evitable la discrimination l absence de droit la defense
french les citoyens veulent avoir une bonne administration
french ils veulent tre des citoyens actifs
french ces conclusions peuvent tre tirees du nombre sans cesse croissant de plaintes adressees au mediateur et de ce qu elles impliquent
french le mediateur s est fait conna tre pour son travail en faveur d une plus grande publicite
french il merite pour cela un grand eloge
french une enqu te qu il a realisee de sa propre initiative il y a plusieurs annees a permis la plupart des institutions et organes communautaires d avoir aujourd hui une reglementation pour l acc s du public aux documents
french il a poursuivi son travail sans rel che pour une veritable transparence et pour que la confidentialite des donnees et la protection des personnes ne soient pas non plus utilisees pour entraver la transparence des activites des autorites vis vis du public
french petit petit le mediateur europeen a developpe son travail x uvre pour une meilleure administration et obtenu la confiance des citoyens
french sa collaboration avec les mediateurs nationaux de m me que par la suite avec les organes analogues dans les pays candidats est tout aussi importante
french c est un travail serieux que le parlement a raison de soutenir
french cet appui doit se faire via l octroi de ressources economiques suffisantes au mediateur pour lui permettre de mener bien les enqu tes astreignantes qu implique le mandat
french nous devons egalement veiller dorenavant soutenir un mediateur qui soit independant dans ses decisions
french je voudrais adresser un grand merci au mediateur et son cabinet ainsi qu au secretariat de la commission des petitions qui nous le savons aujourd hui travaille dans des conditions difficiles
french monsieur le president la commission des petitions du parlement est une assemblee un peu particuli re
french comme les deux oratrices precedentes l ont precise elle re oit les plaintes des citoyens europeens qui estiment que leur droits ont ete bafoues
french en tant que rapporteur pour avis en ce qui concerne le droit de sejour je voudrais faire quelques remarques par rapport aux probl mes specifiques dans ce domaine
french la libre circulation des personnes est une des libertes fondamentales que nous a permis d atteindre l integration europeenne
french depuis le traite de maastricht il existe un droit de sejour general conditionne par des moyens d existence et une couverture des risques de maladie suffisants
french une limitation de la liberte de circulation et du droit de sejour est uniquement admise pour des raisons d ordre public de securite et de sante
french l experience de la commission des petitions montre que le droit la libre circulation butte dans la pratique sur de nombreux probl mes a l application hesitante des dispositions communautaires par les etats membres b les probl mes professionnels specifiques en ce qui concerne la reconnaissance des dipl mes et des brevets d etudes c la non adaptation des dispositions en mati re de securite sociale par exemple en ce qui concerne la complexite des formulaires de remboursement des frais medicaux
french une analyse de la procedure d infraction de fait appara tre dans cas un rapport direct entre la petition et la procedure d infraction devant la cour de justice des communautes europeennes
french on peut regretter que le conseil de ministres ignore reguli rement les communications de la commission des petitions quant aux atteintes graves des autorites des etats membres contre le droit communautaire
french c est la preuve d une attitude negative par rapport au droit de petition des citoyens et citoyennes europeens
french l avenir le conseil devrait accorder l attention qui s impose aux droits des citoyens de l union
french monsieur le president le droit de petition et de plainte n est pas une invention recente
french il y a ans dej les petitionnaires romains pouvaient faire part de leurs inquietudes l empereur
french toutefois ce droit devait constamment tre menace modifie limite ou supprime
french les petitionnaires d autrefois sont devenus les citoyens europeens emancipes d aujourd hui
french aucune administration ou institution n est infaillible
french nombre de petitions laissent appara tre un desequilibre entre la legislation et l integration europeenne
french les petitions sont de ce fait un barom tre permettant d evaluer les relations entre les citoyens et le legislateur ces petitions sont multiples
french une population de hamsters dans une zone industrielle nous preoccupe tout autant que l interdiction des implants de silicone ou l introduction d une taxe sur les poids lourds
french j en viens present au mediateur
french mon groupe politique felicite le mediateur pour le travail qu il a accompli au cours de l annee
french le merite de m s derman a ete et est surtout d x uvrer pour plus de transparence et de publicite au sein de l administration europeenne
french etant donne que la plupart des plaintes pour lesquelles le mediateur est competent concernent la commission europeenne et se fondent sur un manque de transparence il convient de travailler cette t che
french l acc s aux documents non seulement pour les citoyens europeens mais egalement pour le mediateur en fait partie
french m me l introduction de nouvelles technologies dans les bureaux ne peut constituer une raison emp chant la transparence
french des reponses fondees l attention des citoyens suscitent la confiance le comportement oppose entra ne la mefiance et une augmentation du nombre de plaintes qui doivent tre traitees et qui gen rent de nouveaux co ts
french on peut d s lors se rejouir de l initiative lancee par le mediateur en faveur d un code de bonne conduite administrative
french le citoyen a le droit fondamental une administration ouverte orientee vers les services et responsable qui est somme toute financee par ses contributions
french j estime que l independance du mediateur europeen en tant qu exemple pour l introduction des mediateurs nationaux dans les pays candidats et dans mon land de thuringe rev t une importance capitale
french monsieur le president monsieur le mediateur europeen les liberaux et moi m me sommes fiers de voir que notre mediateur est un homme courageux actif et energique
french il est extr mement important pour nous d avoir une personne d une telle integrite qui ose se battre pour l ouverture et la transparence et contre la culture de la manigance du secret et malheureusement dans certains cas de la fraude et de la corruption egalement presentes au sein des institutions europeennes
french seule une administration transparente et publique peut recevoir le soutien de ceux qui travaillent ici parmi les hommes politiques et les citoyens que nous representons
french la ligne adoptee par le mediateur beneficie d un important soutien de la part des citoyens de tous les etats membres
french c est un fait incontestable et plusieurs rapports scientifiques internationaux montrent qu il existe une relation evidente entre un haut degre de transparence et de publicite dans l administration et un faible niveau de corruption
french l inverse est egalement vrai et une administration fermee et secr te a tendance engendrer un haut degre de corruption
french c est bien s r egalement vrai dans les institutions europeennes
french c est la raison pour laquelle il est aussi important d avoir un mediateur totalement independant qui puisse agir de lui m me et sans pression ou inter t d aucune sorte visant l influencer
french le nombre croissant de plaintes qui parviennent au mediateur souligne l utilite de notre mediateur qui agit reellement dans l inter t des citoyens
french la seule critique que l on puisse lui adresser est que l institution est malheureusement toujours trop peu connue dans de nombreux etats membres et que trop peu de citoyens connaissent ce droit
french c est un point sur lequel je voudrais que l on se concentre l avenir
french en resume le mediateur joue un r le tr s important
french je voudrais le feliciter pour le travail qu il a accompli tout au long de l annee et lui souhaiter bonne chance pour le futur
french monsieur le president madame la commissaire monsieur le mediateur il est peut tre utile de se rappeler qu il y a seulement un an et demi on discutait dans ce b timent de la necessite d une commission des petitions
french je suis tr s heureuse de pouvoir constater que la commission des petitions a prouve son utilite surtout en ce moment o nous voulons renforcer la situation du citoyen de l union europeenne
french je souhaite vraiment que la commission des petitions reussisse cooperer efficacement avec les autres commissions pendant l annee venir
french je suis convaincue que nous pourrons rediger des rapports communs sur les principaux sujets probl mes
french en ce qui concerne le mediateur il a vraiment affermi son autorite et son independance
french le nombre croissant des plaintes est la preuve que les citoyens l ont trouve nous les membres du parlement europeen avons souvent pu guider les citoyens vers le mediateur afin qu ils trouvent une solution leurs probl mes
french l avenir l acc s facilite aux documents sera une question qui nous donnera du travail et dans cette mati re nous avons dej re u des conseils precieux de la part du mediateur
french monsieur le president on ne peut dire que tr s peu de choses en une minute mon intervention sera donc synthetique
french premi rement je voudrais remercier le rapporteur mme lambert d avoir repris toutes nos propositions au cours du debat
french voil pourquoi aucun amendement n a ete depose
french deuxi mement je voudrais dire qu l heure actuelle personne ne doute que la commission des petitions et le mediateur contribuent considerablement au respect du droit communautaire
french nous le constatons tous les jours au sein de la commission des petitions
french en consequence comme mme hautala je me rejouis que la commission des petitions ait survecu aux tentatives visant la faire dispara tre car celle ci outre sa mission en mati re de respect du droit communautaire est la commission qui est la plus proche des citoyens
french c est la commission qui rend les institutions plus visibles aupr s des citoyens
french le plus grand probl me est sans doute que la lenteur du processus qui suit la plainte deposee par un citoyen
french le citoyen qui a d abord d etudier le droit communautaire pour presenter sa petition doit attendre la reponse pendant des mois
french les petitions les plus nombreuses sont celles qui portent sur les affaires sociales et l environnement sujets qui suscitent le plus d inquietudes
french parfois monsieur le president et j en termine lorsqu on denonce l expulsion d un citoyen ou la destruction d une zone naturelle la reponse arrive lorsque le probl me ne peut plus tre resolu
french l acceleration du traitement des petitions est donc un point important point que mme lambert a repris
french monsieur le president les deputes radicaux de la liste bonino soutiendront les deux rapports tout comme ils apprecient et approuvent le travail du mediateur
french nous voudrions toutefois poser une question precise et ponctuelle au mediateur sur le fait qu il n est pas encore possible de porter plainte en utilisant la signature electronique
french ce probl me concerne selon nous toutes les institutions notamment pour ce qui est du travail au sein du parlement mais aussi parce que l inter t du mediateur est que l on accorde la plus grande attention possible son travail de notre c te nous pensons qu en ce qui concerne le mediateur la signature electronique peut constituer la premi re etape de l introduction de cet instrument au sein de nos institutions
french je voudrais seulement revenir sur un passage essentiel qui a ete sous estime
french soixante dix sept pour cent des plaintes recevables visent la commission
french le mediateur nous a dit que la commission n avait accompli aucun progr s cette annee dans le domaine de la transparence la transparence qui est un instrument efficace contre la fraude et la corruption
french en particulier le president prodi s etait engage le decembre trouver et proposer des solutions juridiques et organisationnelles pour assurer aux candidats aux concours tant internes qu externes de la commission la possibilite d acceder aux copies d epreuves corrigees
french nous voudrions que le mediateur nous dise comme il nous a rappele qu europol avait encore besoin de temps si la promesse formulee le decembre dernier par le president prodi d assurer l acc s aux copies d epreuves corrigees avant le er juillet s est dej concretisee
french monsieur le president chers coll gues la lecture du rapport annuel du mediateur je peux conclure que le manque de transparence suffisante constitue la raison la plus importante des plaintes introduites par les citoyens on l a dej dit
french tous les intervenants ne semblent pourtant pas avoir conscience de ce probl me
french la commission a depose une proposition de r glement relative l acc s public aux documents dont vous avez juste titre m s derman critique ouvertement les insuffisances
french nous avons pu lire certaines choses ce sujet
french pour se faire une idee de l esprit dont est empreint cette proposition il suffit de lire les declarations faites par le comite consultatif des experts independants
french selon le deuxi me rapport des experts je cite la commission a besoin d espace pour reflechir la definition de sa politique avant que celle ci n entre dans le domaine public precisement parce que la politique faite sous les feux de la publicite et en direct est souvent de pi tre qualite
french en tant que representante de l opinion publique cette approche des questions de transparence et de politique m est dans l ensemble inacceptable
french c est la raison pour laquelle j apporte mon soutien aux critiques fondees que vous avez formulees monsieur s derman
french monsieur le president je voudrais mon tour feliciter et remercier le mediateur pour le rapport qu il a presente cette annee ainsi que mme thors et mme lambert pour leurs rapports au parlement
french tous ces rapports en particulier celui du mediateur illustrent le travail tr s fiable et serieux qui a ete accompli au cours de cette annee
french nul doute que les citoyens europeens ont besoin d une personne vers qui se tourner s ils rencontrent des probl mes avec l administration et en la personne de m s derman je sais que nous disposons d un mediateur sur lequel nous pouvons compter
french j en ai ete le temoin lorsque j ai participe au seminaire paris
french il etait tr s agreable de constater quel point le mediateur europeen etait estime par ses coll gues les mediateurs nationaux
french de ce c te de l assemblee nous croyons certainement que le mediateur devrait disposer de tous les pouvoirs dont il a besoin pour s acquitter de ses responsabilites
french en ce qui concerne l acc s aux documents il se trouve que nous pensons que le point de vue de la commission des affaires constitutionnelles est important mais il ne faudrait pas comprendre que nous ayons un quelconque doute quant au principe selon lequel le mediateur doit avoir acc s aux documents
french nous le soutenons pleinement en la mati re
french il est surprenant de constater que l annee derni re la commission des petitions etait quelque peu menacee et le rapport de mme lambert montre l excellent travail accompli par la commission des petitions
french avec m gemelli notre president nous examinons maintenant des mesures en vue de rendre la commission des petitions plus utile et plus efficace dans le travail qu elle effectue au nom des citoyens
french une des choses importantes que nous presenterons au parlement est un code de bonne conduite administrative
french il est important que les citoyens et les fonctionnaires sachent ce que conduite raisonnable signifie afin que tous puissent disposer d une norme de reference
french je voudrais egalement remercier la commission pour le soutien que nous avons re u en commission des petitions soutien d excellente qualite et tr s efficace tout au long de l annee
french j esp re que sous la presidence fran aise nous obtiendrons le m me soutien de la part du conseil lequel a malheureusement fait defaut par le passe
french monsieur le president tout d abord je felicite les deux rapporteurs de leurs observations interessantes
french en etendant toujours davantage ses actions de nouveaux cycles d activites lesquelles couvrent dej un large eventail des inter ts de chaque citoyen l union europeenne se metamorphose en un leviathan moderne amenant avec lui tous les actes arbitraires inevitablement lies tout mecanisme administratif et qui vus sous certains angles tendent devenir plus dangereux que les actes correspondants des services nationaux des etats
french et cela parce que les mecanismes de contr le n ont pas suivi l evolution de ces activites
french il y a trois moyens de faire obstacle aux dangers impliques par le vaste mecanisme administratif de l union europeenne
french l un d eux est l intervention plus directe et plus frequente du parlement europeen dans le contr le des activites specifiques des organes de l union europeenne
french cet egard il faut donner suite aux propositions du rapporteur mme thors qui demande la commission d inclure dans le rapport annuel relatif au droit communautaire un chapitre consacre l examen des petitions et des plaintes ainsi qu sa proposition de conclure un accord interinstitutionnel qui facilitera l examen plus rapide des petitions
french pour elargir le sens de ces deux propositions je dirais que le parlement europeen doit l avenir consacrer plus de temps ces questions qui sont d ailleurs tout aussi importantes pour lui puisqu il ferait avancer son droit de revendiquer la codecision avec le conseil
french plus generalement il est temps d asseoir l exercice du contr le parlementaire sur une nouvelle base
french le deuxi me moyen est l institutionnalisation de la charte europeenne des droits fondamentaux laquelle aura force obligatoire et assurera les droits qui permettront directement aux citoyens europeens d exiger non seulement des droits de procedure mais aussi des droits relatifs au contenu qui protegeront juste titre leurs inter ts et se transformeront en droit de dedommagement en cas d atteinte aux inter ts
french la perspective manifeste de l elaboration d une charte de caract re simplement declaratif ne manquera pas de porter un coup la credibilite de l union europeenne qui alors qu elle consid re dans un flot de paroles la transparence dans le fonctionnement de ses organes comme l un des objectifs fondamentaux de sa politique et l approche du citoyen europeen comme un element necessaire l integration s abstient de reconna tre ce mecanisme elementaire indispensable pour atteindre ces objectifs
french enfin le troisi me moyen est le renforcement et l amelioration du r le du mediateur notamment en lui facilitant l acc s tous les documents qui rendent plus efficace le deroulement des enqu tes
french parall lement la richesse du contenu de son rapport devra faire l objet d une etude scrupuleuse et constituer un point de depart pour les indispensables reformes du fonctionnement des organes communautaires
french je souhaite bon courage au mediateur dans la poursuite de sa t che
french monsieur le president je voudrais avant toute chose remercier le mediateur europeen m s derman les deux rapporteurs mmes lambert et thors tous les coll gues de la commission des petitions et le bureau
french nous basons notre reflexion sur la conviction que les institutions representent un instrument au service des citoyens et partant la violation presumee des droits des citoyens debouche sur une crise de confiance envers les institutions
french aujourd hui je pense que nous devons creer un contexte juridique global harmonieux et fonctionnel et donc creer les instruments juridictionnels la charte des droits de l homme un corpus juris instituant un droit penal un droit civil et un droit administratif les procedures d accord sur la reconnaissance mutuelle des arr ts des etats membres europol et les accords sectoriels l olaf en tant qu instrument de detection des infractions la probable nomination d un procureur europeen qui devrait tre le bureau d enqu te de la cour de justice la distinction entre l exercice du pouvoir d enqu te et du pouvoir de jugement le profil des responsabilites penales civiles et administratives voil autant d instruments qui font progresser l union europeenne
french l accord cadre d hier pose un jalon dans cette direction
french nous voudrions demander une derni re chose savoir que la commission des petitions puisse donner en procedure de codecision en tant que parlement l interpretation authentique de certaines de ses decisions ainsi que la modification des traites dans le sens de la rationalisation de l ensemble du syst me juridique et juridictionnel et des instruments en vigueur
french monsieur le president monsieur le mediateur madame la commissaire chers coll gues je remercie les rapporteurs pour leur travail tr s approfondi et serieux
french le mediateur surveille le conflit entre le pouvoir et l objet du pouvoir et y remedie il y a eu presque quelques milliers de cas l annee derni re
french je propose sept principes
french plus une union est grande plus grand est aussi le besoin de transparence
french plus elle est jeune plus grand est ce besoin et plus elle est compliquee meilleure doit tre la transparence
french plus on avance vers une societe de l information plus elle doit tre ouverte et plus elle est civilisee plus elle est aussi publique
french plus elle sera multiculturelle meilleure sera la transparence et plus elle sera democratique plus elle sera ouverte
french nous avons l habitude que tous les appareils soient accompagnes de d emploi m me les fouets de cuisine
french les principes de la bonne administration crees avec merite par le mediateur constitue le mode d emploi de la bureaucratie europeenne l intention des citoyens
french et il est bien vrai que ce mode d emploi est utile
french il n y a pas de democratie sans une bonne administration et pour cela il faut vraiment inclure les principes de la bonne administration l acte fondamental de l union
french encore une chose importante dans la societe de l information il faut porter la transparence des dossiers et les principes qui les gouvernent un niveau digne d elle gr ce aux nouvelles techniques autrement dit il faut pouvoir deposer plainte sur l internet
french les decisions prealables et les documents afferents doivent aussi tre disponibles en temps reel ma proposition est que nous avons besoin d un portail du mediateur l internet
french merci pour votre travail
french monsieur le president en tant que membre de la commission des petitions je tiens feliciter tout particuli rement ma coll gue mme lambert pour son excellent rapport et je remercie la commission europeenne pour son aide precieuse au traitement des petitions que nous recevons
french la petition est un droit reconnu aux citoyens europeens et aux residents de l union leur permettant de faire prevaloir les droits que leur reconnaissent les traites
french or peu de citoyens ont conscience de la possibilite de deposer une petition
french les dossiers que nous traitons font d ailleurs ressortir une meconnaissance des droits que conf re la citoyennete europeenne
french cela se traduit malheureusement par de petitions irrecevables
french les petitions qui sont recevables soul vent particuli rement les probl mes de liberte de circulation d etablissement de prestations de services de prestations sociales de reconnaissance de dipl mes et de qualifications et de fiscalite
french en outre nous sommes saisis de plus en plus par des petitions collectives portant sur des sujets lies l environnement et avec l extension des competences de l union il est envisageable que le nombre de ces petitions et des domaines traites augmentera
french pour repondre aux attentes des citoyens il est necessaire qu il y ait une bonne cohesion entre la commission des petitions les institutions europeennes et les administrations nationales
french une meilleure prise en compte du travail de notre commission par les autres commissions parlementaires est aussi necessaire
french il est prejudiciable au bon traitement des petitions que le conseil soit chroniquement absent aux reunions de notre commission
french en effet les administrations nationales sont les premi res appliquer le droit communautaire et il est indispensable qu elles travaillent en coherence avec les institutions europeennes et notamment le parlement et la commission
french nous attendons trop longtemps les reponses des administrations nationales parfois m me pendant plusieurs annees
french nous avons pleinement conscience de l ampleur de la t che et des difficultes surmonter
french tout d abord il est indeniable qu il existe un manque de notoriete de cette commission alors que son travail est indispensable pour resserrer le lien entre citoyens et union europeenne
french en outre il faut renforcer les structures et les moyens de cette commission pour ameliorer son efficacite et une relation plus etroite avec les commissions des petitions des parlements nationaux est souhaitable
french enfin une europe plus proche des citoyens est un des points forts du programme de la presidence fran aise
french le travail de notre commission rentre dans ce cadre et il nous appartient de concretiser cette attente
french monsieur le president je voudrais souhaiter la bienvenue ce matin m s derman et feliciter mme lambert et mme thors pour leurs rapports
french la realite de nos societe est telle que si on laissait faire les gouvernements et les administrations ils ne nommeraient jamais de commissions des petitions ou de mediateurs
french par nature ils tendent au secret
french ces commissions et ces mediateurs n existent que parce que les citoyens et leurs representants publics exigent qu ils existent et les defendent quand ils existent
french d s lors il est important que nous continuions d exiger que des ressources adequates soient affectes au bureau du mediateur et la commission des petitions du parlement
french une mani re d etouffer l efficacite du bureau du mediateur et de la commission des petitions est de leur refuser des ressources adequates
french il est scandaleux qu au sein du parlement la commission des petitions l unique et le plus important contact direct dont le citoyen dispose avec cette institution et avec les autres institutions de l union europeenne soit traitee de la sorte
french elle ne dispose pas d assistance adequate en mati re de secretariat
french elle est traite de mani re abominable en ce qui concerne les traductions qui occupent le bas de la liste
french cela ne suffit tout simplement pas
french j en appellerais la commission et au conseil s ils etaient representes ils ignorent la commission des petitions ainsi que le parlement afin qu ils fournissent les ressources necessaires au travail de ces organismes
french la commission des petitions constitue en particulier un important mecanisme d acc s pour les europeens
french il est important que nous fassions en sorte qu elle accomplisse son travail efficacement
french les deux questions les plus importantes qui surgissent au sein de la commission des petitions sont la reconnaissance des qualifications des personnes travailler dans d autres etats membres et l impact environnemental du developpement de la construction
french en particulier les citoyens sont preoccupes par le fait que les etudes d impact sur l environnement requises dans le cadre de la legislation de l ue sont traitees comme si elles n avaient pas plus de valeur que le papier sur lequel elles sont ecrites
french soit elles sont ignorees soit elles n aborde pas les veritables probl mes
french monsieur le president je voudrais feliciter personnellement jacob s derman pour l excellent travail realise qui a conduit sa reelection le octobre de l annee derni re
french je voudrais par la m me occasion feliciter le mediateur pour son rapport annuel tr s facile lire et en m me temps complet
french il ressort du rapport que la commission avec pr s de pour cent des cas fait l objet de la plupart des enqu tes qui ont ete realisees
french cela tient sans doute avant tout au fait que la commission est l institution qui prend la plupart des decisions en rapport direct avec les citoyens
french dans le rapport relatif aux plaintes individuelles il appara t cependant que la transparence est insuffisante
french la raison la plus souvent invoquee dans les plaintes etait egalement l insuffisance et la manque d informations
french la transparence est essentielle pour que les citoyens aient plus de chances d influencer le fonctionnement de l ue et aussi de mettre un terme aux tendances la corruption la fraude et l abus de confiance
french je voudrais souligner le fait que ce rapport insiste pour que l ensemble des institutions et organes de l ue etablissent un code de bonne conduite administrative
french on court toutefois le risque comme le souligne egalement le rapport annuel du mediateur que la portee d un tel code varie aupr s des differents organes et institutions
french le c te relations publiques de l activite du mediateur a ete mis en evidence plus t t par d autres intervenants et ne doit jamais tre sous estime
french je voudrais terminer par quelques questions quelles sont les consequences d une charte des droits fondamentaux sur le travail du mediateur
french les ressources sont elles suffisantes pour que le travail soit bien fait
french quelles sont les principales raisons des deficiences des institutions dans leurs relations avec les citoyens
french la volonte fait elle defaut les ressources sont elles insuffisantes ou a t on une bureaucratie inadaptee qui emp che et retarde le traitement des affaires
french monsieur le president sur la base des rapports du mediateur et de mme thors on peut constater que l institution mediateur a consolide sa position
french la commission applaudit le travail accompli par m jacob s derman et se felicite que les citoyens l aient trouve
french les piliers de base du travail du mediateur sont l independance et la transparence
french il est tout aussi juste de souligner l importance de la bonne gouvernance pour les citoyens et pour la legitimite de l ue aux yeux des citoyens
french il est bon que la commission soutienne le mediateur dans ses efforts de mettre en x uvre un r glement en la mati re
french le principe de la bonne gouvernance sera egalement inscrit la charte des droits fondamentaux de l ue qui est en train de se preparer
french le rapport rev le qu environ trente pour cent seulement des plaintes adressees au mediateur entrent dans ses competences
french il faut donc continuer developper la cooperation entre le mediateur europeen et les mediateurs nationaux et regionaux
french monsieur le president mesdames et messieurs les deputes je suis heureuse de participer aujourd hui ce debat avec m s derman mediateur dont le travail au service des citoyens de l union est essentiel
french la commission l apprecie donc de mani re tr s positive
french je veux dire que la commission estime que le citoyen doit toujours tre au centre de nos preoccupations
french c est en effet le citoyen qui est le destinataire ultime de toutes nos activites et notre raison d tre
french en ce sens la commission des petitions et le mediateur jouent un r le cle differents niveaux avec des effets differents mais essentiel pour l amelioration du fonctionnement des institutions
french la commission des petitions s occupe des preoccupations concr tes des citoyens et en ce sens comme le signale mme lambert que je felicite sinc rement pour son rapport les petitions presentees au parlement illustrent les probl mes des citoyens face aux administrations europeennes et souvent nationales tout en mettant l accent sur les lacunes legislatives existant au niveau europeen et national
french le mediateur pour sa part comme l indique mme thors que je tiens egalement feliciter sinc rement pour son rapport s occupe des plaintes contre les institutions et organes de l union quant aux deficiences de leurs administrations
french il nous incite ameliorer la gestion et la qualite des services en nous signalant les points faibles les points qui doivent tre ameliores qui doivent faire l objet d une plus grande attention
french mais les premiers vouloir une administration plus efficace et plus transparente etant precisement les responsables de ces administrations les critiques quant nos defauts sont les bienvenues
french ce n est qu en connaissant les defauts que l on peut y remedier
french d o j insiste l importance que nous accordons en vue du bon fonctionnement des institutions au travail du mediateur et de la commission des petitions
french quant au rapport de mme lambert je voudrais aborder deux points concrets
french l un porte sur la cooperation entre les institutions indispensable pour ameliorer le fonctionnement de la commission des petitions et sa capacite d action
french cet egard je voudrais exprimer ma satisfaction car le rapport souligne le r le constructif de la commission dans l examen des petitions et parce qu il le consid re globalement satisfaisant
french en quelque sorte elle nous accorde une note satisfaisante et je l en remercie mais nous essayerons de nous ameliorer
french cela nous encourage simplement fournir davantage d efforts ameliorer notre travail et assurer une plus grande collaboration
french deuxi mement il propose une revision des procedures d examen de la commission des petitions
french eh bien permettez moi de vous dire que je trouve excellente l idee de regrouper l examen des petitions par sujets de confier des rapporteurs specialises la t che d examiner ces petitions avec plus d attention et eventuellement de tirer des conclusions permettant de corriger les deficiences prendre des decisions pour resoudre d eventuelles lacunes dans les textes legislatifs ou de contrecarrer les effets non desirables desdits textes
french la commission est egalement disposee envisager une revision de l accord interinstitutionnel sur le traitement des petitions modifiant celui qui est actuellement en vigueur depuis avec le parlement et le conseil surtout dans un domaine qui me semble essentiel et qui a ete signale par l un des intervenants savoir le probl me des delais de reponse
french certes nous mettons parfois beaucoup de temps pour repondre
french ce n est pas toujours de la faute de la commission nous dependons parfois des reponses des administrations nationales mais il est vrai que dans ce domaine nous devons faire un effort pour nous ameliorer et pour tre m me de contribuer de mani re plus satisfaisante encore au travail de cette commission
french cet egard je tiens souligner l importance de la collaboration avec d autres administrations collaboration que nous voulons ameliorer au maximum
french la commission est ouverte au dialogue avec le parlement et le conseil afin d ameliorer les delais des reponses et augmenter la transparence et la communication avec le parlement et la commission des petitions
french concernant le rapport thors je vous dirai que nous sommes d accord quant la necessite de consolider l independance du mediateur en tant qu institution et de soutenir son travail en faveur de la transparence et de l ouverture
french evidemment nous considerons que le principe de motivation des decisions qui concernent les citoyens est essentiel et nous tentons de l appliquer de mani re systematique
french je voudrais aussi dire que nous acceptons la definition selon laquelle il y a mauvaise administration lorsqu un organisme public n agit pas en conformite avec une r gle ou un principe ayant pour lui force obligatoire
french toutefois je tiens preciser que comme l a tr s bien signale m s derman le mediateur est un organe non judiciaire d s lors il ne peut en aucun cas se substituer aux organes judiciaires
french ses t ches sont differentes de celles de la cour de justice
french je pense qu il est tr s important dans les relations entre commission mediateur et autres institutions et organes de respecter systematiquement l equilibre institutionnel stipule dans les traites
french en ce sens il est vrai que la realite de plus en plus importante de l institution du mediateur qui est certains egards une institution plus jeune que d autres dans le dispositif institutionnel europeen a besoin d un certain temps de maturation pour que les citoyens la connaissent
french le mediateur signale dans son rapport que l annee derni re les plaintes et les enqu tes ont considerablement augmente ce qui est simplement d au fait que les citoyens connaissent mieux cette institution
french il faut egalement un temps de maturation dans les relations du mediateur avec les autres institutions pour etablir les equilibres souhaitables et resoudre les tensions logiques pouvant exister jusqu ce que tout fonctionne parfaitement
french mais je dois dire que jusqu present la collaboration entre la commission et l institution du mediateur et tr s certainement la personne qui la represente m s derman a ete magnifique
french mesdames et messieurs je voudrais tr s bri vement signaler que ces institutions sont bonnes car toute action d une administration peut un moment donne manquer de transparence et d efficacite porter atteinte aux droits fondamentaux ou encore tre minee par la corruption
french mais je voudrais vous dire mesdames et messieurs que l on ne peut en aucun cas presenter l administration communautaire comme etant particuli rement minee par ces defauts
french si on la compare avec d autres administrations je pense qu elle supporte tr s bien la comparaison et qu elle merite m me une bonne note dans ces domaines
french mesdames et messieurs pour terminer je voudrais feliciter nouveau le mediateur m s derman de son travail de plus en plus important de ses actions de plus en plus nombreuses et de sa collaboration parfois critique mais comme l assume la commission telle est sa t che et sa fonction
french la redaction d un code de conduite applicable aux relations des fonctionnaires communautaires avec les citoyens est une priorite et m kinnock et la commission en general x uvrent dans ce sens
french quant aux modifications du statut du mediateur c est la commission parlementaire competente qui doit le cas echeant rendre une decision conformement l article du traite et lorsque le parlement prendra l initiative nous analyserons toutes les questions pertinentes
french mesdames et messieurs je voudrais encore feliciter les deux rapporteurs et bien entendu m s derman de l excellent travail qu il realise avec rigueur et independance
french monsieur le president je vous remercie de m avoir donne la parole pour repondre aux questions
french m turco a pose une question ayant trait au droit de deposer une plainte par courrier electronique
french depuis quelques annees il est possible d envoyer des courriers electroniques au bureau du mediateur depuis que m dell alba nous en a fait reconna tre l importance
french actuellement environ des plaintes nous arrivent par courrier electronique
french si vous consultez notre site web vous trouverez un formulaire qui peut tre envoye immediatement par courrier electronique
french m paasilinna a declare que le site web pouvait tre developpe dans cette direction
french nous disposons dej d un acc s direct tous les sites web des mediateurs nationaux ou regionaux mais cela pourrait davantage se developper
french m raschhofer a mentionne le projet de r glement sur l acc s public aux document dont on a debattu
french je voudrais souligner le fait que ce projet de r glement est present presente au parlement
french le travail en commission peut commencer
french lors des discussions que j ai menees avec m prodi celui ci m a indique qu il etait pr t envisager favorablement toute proposition bien fondee en vue d ameliorer ce r glement
french ce projet est present l examen devant le parlement
french m malmstr m a mentionne la meconnaissance du bureau du mediateur au sein des etats membres
french la difficulte que nous avons rencontree a ete que si nous faisons trop de publicite pour nous m mes nous recevons trop de plaintes depassant le cadre de notre mandat
french nous essayons d s lors d identifier les citoyens qui rencontrent des probl mes avec l administration et qui pourraient avoir des raisons de se plaindre
french les deputes du parlement constituent une source tr s importante d informations pour bon nombre de citoyens
french je serais tr s heureux si vous pouviez contribuer faire en sorte que les possibilites de deposer des petitions et des plaintes soient mieux connues des citoyens
french merci monsieur s derman
french le debat est clos
french le vote aura lieu aujourd hui heures
french ciel unique europeen
french l ordre du jour appelle le rapport a de m atkins au nom de la commission de la politique regionale des transports et du tourisme sur la communication de la commission au conseil et au parlement europeen relative la creation du ciel unique europeen com c cos
french monsieur le president nous nous reunissons un moment o la congestion dans nos cieux n a jamais ete aussi grande
french selon les statistiques la frequence des retards de minute a augmente de en en et continue augmenter
french nous nous preoccupons non seulement des effets de la congestion en termes de desagrement ainsi que des implications sur la stabilite de notre union mais nous nous faisons avant tout du souci propos des menaces pour la securite qui en resultent
french il est un fait qu il y a une penurie de contr leurs aeriens
french il est un fait qu il y a eu un manque d investissement dans les syst mes de contr le du trafic aerien
french le fait que la demande de transports aeriens s accro t pour ainsi dire chaque jour en raison des tarifs reduits du desir de voyager l etranger pour les vacances et les affaires ou m me parce qu il est possible de prendre quelques jours de pause un jet de pierre a augmente la pression laquelle est soumis le trafic aerien
french tandis que cette pression s accro t nous nous devons de feliciter ceux qui travaillent dans le syst me et les remercier pour ce qu ils ont accompli
french malheureusement et ce n est pas enti rement de leur faute ils n arrivent pas faire face aux pressions aussi bien que nous l aurions souhaite nous en avons tous fait l experience il y a peu de temps peine cause des retards dus la gr ve en france
french d s lors tout cela a un impact negatif sur la mobilite de nos citoyens et sur les co ts economiques financiers et sociaux supportes par nos entreprises et un grand nombre d autres personnes affectes quotidiennement par les evenement
french je voudrais feliciter la commissaire de palacio pour avoir pris l initiative d en referer notre commission dans les termes qu elle a utilises avec la force et la verve dont elle a fait preuve initialement en etablissant le groupe de haut niveau ainsi que dans le leadership dont elle a fait usage pour aborder ce probl me
french la commission a apporte une contribution majeure au traitement de la saturation de l espace aerien
french le conseil des ministres des transports doit prendre une decision politique en vue d aborder ce probl me
french nous ne pouvons la repousser plus longtemps
french c est maintenant qu il faut lui accorder notre attention
french nous avons besoin d un ciel unique couvrant un marche unique mais en m me temps nous devons reconna tre le fait que des etats nations particuliers ont une opinion sur la mani re dont ces th mes doivent tre abordes en particulier dans la mesure o ceux ci ont des repercussions sur le revenu des effectifs ainsi que sur l utilisation de l espace aerien national des fins militaires
french nous devons egalement aborder la question posee par l espace aerien militaire et les abus qui s y rapportent dans certains pays et ce non seulement en ce qui concerne l espace occupe par les avions militaires mais egalement l occupation abusive des couloirs aeriens civils par des avions militaires qui ne se conforment par aux procedures aeriennes civiles
french ce domaine doit egalement tre aborde
french dans ce rapport j ai avance une suggestion que la commission a largement acceptee selon laquelle eurocontrol devrait tre un organisme de regulation detenant davantage de pouvoir et appliquant des sanctions plus efficaces en outre les parties lesees pourraient utiliser le droit d appel contre eurocontrol
french de m me nous estimons que l offre de services relatifs au trafic aerien devrait tre ouverte la liberalisation et sujette aux decisions que chaque pays particulier consid re comme appropriees
french comme les deputes le savent peut tre au royaume uni nous avons aborde la question en introduisant le principe de liberalisation
french cela peut s averer judicieux pour nous
french cela peut tre malheureux pour d autres
french la decision revient chaque etat membres mais ils doivent decider de s attaquer au probl me de la division entre d une part la reglementation de l espace aerien et d autre part la gestion de services aeriens qui pourraient tre effectuee par d autres ou d autres organisations
french nous croyons fermement qu il devrait exister des crit res objectifs et independants sur la mani re dont le syst me est gere crit res assortis d incitants pour ceux qui remplissent les exigences requises et de sanctions pour ceux qui n ont pas atteint les niveaux demandes
french nous pensons que les passagers doivent tre dedommages en cas de retards injustifies et que leurs droits en pareil cas devraient tre clairement definis et reconnus
french mais par dessus tout nous souhaitons que la commissaire de palacio avec notre soutien presse le conseil de ministres et tous les acteurs de ce dossier de prendre des decisions urgentes
french si le secteur doit formuler une critique globale du rapport c est peut tre qu il ne va pas assez loin ou pas assez vite
french cela ne peut plus durer
french c est maintenant que nous devons aborder ce dossier
french monsieur le president je voudrais si vous le permettez vous livrer tr s bri vement les quelques observations que m inspire ce rapport
french il para t evident que l organisation du contr le aerien dans le ciel europeen doit tre enti rement repensee
french en ce sens l initiative de la commission est louable
french qu elle doive tre repensee est une chose que tout doive tre mis plat est une evidence egalement mais je pense qu il faut se mefier d un certain nombre d idees re ues que l on retrouve au gre des rapports des communications et des interventions sur ce sujet
french que le morcellement politique du ciel europeen ne corresponde plus aux exigences techniques et aux exigences du marche para t egalement tre une evidence
french j ai ete extr mement surpris d apprendre que dans l europe d aujourd hui ce sont encore essentiellement les fronti res politiques qui prevalent en mati re d organisation du contr le aerien
french un espace europeen du contr le aerien doit tre cree cet espace doit il cependant tre totalement unifie et selon quels crit res
french je m interroge beaucoup sur les conclusions du rapport
french il me para t evident que le morcellement du contr le aerien comporte un certain nombre d avantages en effet le contr le aerien suppose un maillage du territoire et les limites de securite technique mais egalement les limites humaines supposent que chaque contr leur chaque poste de contr le puisse avoir un territoire limite et un nombre limite de vols suivre
french en ce sens l organisation cellulaire maillee du territoire europeen doit tre conservee et d une certaine fa on enrichie
french je suis donc favorable une multiplication des centres de contr le d s lors qu intervient non pas l unification de tout le contr le mais l unification du syst me juridique et egalement l unification technologique car ce rapport et l instruction de ce rapport ont mis en lumi re l absence de volonte europeenne
french le president retire la parole l orateur
french monsieur le president madame la vice presidente chers coll gues je voudrais tout d abord remercier mon coll gue robert atkins pour l excellent rapport qu il a redige
french il s est donne beaucoup de peine non seulement pour commenter les propositions de la commission mais egalement pour mettre en evidence les lignes directrices
french le grand axe de separation des fonctions de regulation et d execution me semble tout fait justifie
french les points et rappellent que le parlement a dej decide deux reprises de confier la fonction de regulation l union europeenne
french c est la raison pour laquelle je reviens sur les propos du dernier orateur
french il convient bien s r de distinguer le fait que nous disposons de plusieurs societes de services dans le domaine operationnel mais la fonction de regulation doit rester au niveau europeen voire lui tre confiee dans une plus large mesure
french cela ne pose absolument aucun probl me
french l union europeenne compte aujourd hui etats membres douze etats ont demande de pouvoir y adherer
french si l on op re dej selon le syst me eee on etablit les r gles communes et on consulte les etats candidats l adhesion on peut alors les y integrer
french c est la raison pour laquelle je trouve tout fait approprie le fait que la commission europeenne doive present representer les inter ts des etats membres dans la fonction de regulation pour eurocontrol
french nous n avons pas besoin de plusieurs voix mais bien d une unanimite sur la question de la regulation
french je demande avec insistance la commissaire de presenter une nouvelle fois au groupe de travail les propositions que le parlement va adopter aujourd hui et de continuer veiller ce que le groupe de travail produise de tr s bons resultats pratiques
french nous avons une grande estime pour la vice presidente car elle a associe des experts civils et militaires ce groupe et les travaux avancent bien
french il subsiste encore quelques resistances dans le chef de l un ou l autre etat
french nous souhaitons beaucoup de chance et de succ s la vice presidente de mani re pouvoir presenter un excellent programme en octobre
french monsieur le president permettez moi de commencer au nom du parti des socialistes europeens de saluer l initiative de la commissaire
french nous partageons et soutenons ses objectifs
french toutefois nous regrettons peut tre l absence d integration ce qui est apparent si on lit sa communication avec les autres initiatives qu elles poursuit
french nous notons egalement l absence de volonte politique au sein de la commission et du conseil bien qu il vaille peut tre la peine de se rappeler que cette initiative emane du conseil au mois de juin de l annee derni re lorsque celui ci a demande la commissaire de faire cette communication
french en effet au mois de mars de cette annee le conseil de lisbonne a cherche faire des progr s supplementaires que j en suis s r nous appuierions tous
french le parti des socialistes europeens soutient egalement et salue effectivement la position prudemment reflechie du rapporteur
french nous voyons la subsidiarite l x uvre action europeenne l o cela s av re necessaire action nationale l o c est possible
french je voudrais le remercier personnellement pour avoir pris en consideration bon nombre de nos preoccupations en particulier dans le domaine de la securite dont je constate qu elle constitue ses yeux la premi re priorite dans son rapport
french le pse regrette cela constitue une de ses preoccupations principales l absence d analyse des causes reelles des retards de trafic aerien
french capacites des pistes des aeroports planification des vols comportement des passagers infrastructure des aeroports et manque de contr leurs ce qui a ete mentionne par les rapporteurs
french nous nous preoccupons egalement d un deuxi me principe cle que nous soutenons et qui doit tre davantage developpe la separation de la reglementation et des prestataires de services
french cela doit constituer la pierre angulaire de notre nouvelle approche
french eurocontrol doit lui aussi tre reforme reorganise et relance
french le troisi me principe que nous defendons est la liberalisation mais pas la privatisation et quatri mement nous voulons voir ces propositions developpees conjointement avec celles qui concernent une autorite europeenne pour la securite de la navigation aerienne
french en effet la securite devrait constituer avant tout notre r gle directrice et je suis convaincu qu elle deviendra notre principe directeur dans les mois venir
french en europe entre et le trafic aerien a double
french dans les dix prochaines annees il doublera nouveau
french nous devons nous attaquer ce dossier de mani re urgente et rapidement mais d une mani re coherente
french ce que nous voulons peut tre de la commissaire aujourd hui c est qu elle nous presente un calendrier clair quant sa vitesse d action dans les mois venir
french nous savons tous que cet ete des voyageurs attendrons dans des salles d attentes des aeroports se demandant pourquoi leur avion est retarde non pas de quelques minutes mais bien des heures
french esperons que la commissaire puisse nous presenter aujourd hui un calendrier reprenant les dates auxquelles ces retards cesseront
french j attends avec impatience ses commentaires en particulier j attends avec impatience qu elle informe le parlement sur les conclusions du conseil la semaine derni re qui a re u le rapport provisoire du groupe de haut niveau
french j invite instamment mes coll gues soutenir la proposition du rapporteur et j invite la commissaire presenter un calendrier tr s clair
french monsieur le president madame la commissaire chers coll gues je pense que sir robert atkins a rendu un bon rapport
french il indique clairement la direction que nous devons emprunter car la situation dans laquelle nous nous trouvons est absurde nous disposons en effet d un marche unifie pour la navigation aerienne mais notre espace aerien est divise de mani re insensee
french plusieurs coll gues ont d ores et dej expose les consequences qui en decoulent
french si nous souhaitons un espace aerien unifie nous devons evidemment consentir des investissements votre rapport le precise d ailleurs clairement
french le personnel est insuffisant il faudrait engager plusieurs milliers de personnes et investir dans l infrastructure technique
french il est donc evident qu il faut debloquer de l argent
french cela signifie egalement et ce point est mon avis plus critique que des decisions doivent tre prises rapidement au niveau politique lesquelles decisions ne peuvent aller que dans un sens
french nous devons aborder ce th me sur le plan europeen
french nous nous accordons tous reconna tre que les etats membres doivent une fois pour toutes decider de la marche suivre
french de m me les services nationaux doivent savoir que leur temps est revolu que nous devons beneficier d une prestation de services europeens et non nationaux car c est l que le b t blesse si je puis m exprimer ainsi
french l accent doit naturellement tre place sur la prestation de services car le contr le de la navigation aerienne n est pas une fin en soi il s agit d un service offert une compagnie aerienne ses clients
french nous avons tendance l oublier et nous concentrer uniquement sur des details
french si nous parlons de prestation de services au sein d un marche unique cela sous entend la fin des monopoles l existence d une reglementation europeenne claire et partant la suppression des monopoles en mati re de prestation de services
french nous sommes tous d accord ce sujet et j esp re que nous progresserons rapidement
french comme m watts l a dej souligne la securite represente un point essentiel
french il est exclu de faire des concessions quelles qu elles soient ce sujet
french le plus important et je pense que cela ne posera aucun probl me pour vous madame la commissaire est que si le groupe de haut niveau communique ses conclusions au mois d octobre vous nous soumettiez des propositions le plus rapidement possible
french ensuite tout le monde devra faire pression aupr s du conseil de ministres et les etats membres devront prendre les decisions qui s imposent afin d emprunter la voie que nous avons dej plusieurs fois ouverte au sein du parlement europeen et dans le rapport de sir robert atkins
french monsieur le president le rapport traite du probl me de l accroissement du trafic aerien
french je voudrais insister sur un seul aspect de ce rapport ou pour tre plus precis sur une omission majeure de ce rapport
french un certain nombre de propositions sont avancees mais mes yeux le probl me du rapport est que l idee principale consiste dire que la congestion peut simplement tre resolue par le biais de la liberalisation du syst me de gestion et de contr le du trafic aerien
french les options presentees se concentrent sur des arrangements techniques et non sur les tendances sous jacentes
french il est certain qu un ciel unique europeen rendrait l utilisation de l espace aerien europeen plus efficace
french des ameliorations dans la gestion du trafic aerien fourniraient davantage d espace
french la restriction de l utilisation de l espace aerien militaire produirait egalement une difference significative
french cependant aucun de ces arrangements techniques n auront un impact long terme moins que nous abordions le probl me sous jacent savoir la croissance non durable du trafic aerien
french le rapport ne lie pas la question de la congestion la reduction du trafic aerien d s lors celui ci omet une strategie vitale
french c est comme si on rearrangeait les seaux sous un robinet pour arr ter l inondation sans envisager la possibilite de tourner quelque peu le robinet pour reduire le debit de l eau
french considerons les faits
french le recent rapport de la commission stipulait dej que la croissance du secteur de l aviation est non durable et doit tre inversee en outre il prevoit un doublement de la croissance dans les quinze prochaines annees
french cela provoque des probl mes de congestion majeurs mais cela provoque egalement des probl mes environnementaux non seulement le bruit et la pollution pour les personnes vivant aux alentours des aeroports mais egalement des repercussions sur le climat mondial
french les transports aeriens constituent dej la source d emission de gaz effet de serre dont la croissance est la plus rapide dans le monde et pourrait constituer jusqu des emissions d ici
french malheureusement ce rapport n etablit pas le lien vital entre congestion et reduction du trafic aerien et manque d s lors une occasion unique d aborder ces probl mes de mani re durable
french monsieur le president madame la commissaire je pense qu il y a une ambigu te concernant l expression ciel unique europeen parce que le contr le aerien est quand m me vous le savez bien d ores et dej de fait un domaine d activite europeen
french il existe une ma trise europeenne de l espace aerien avec eurocontrol et il existe un organisme le central flow management unit base bruxelles
french c est imparfait s rement mais ils existent
french il faut donc ameliorer la situation partir du constat evident pour chacun que les retards se sont accentues et que le trafic augmentant ils vont se developper
french il est reconnu que les causes des retards sont multiples mais finalement je trouve qu on est face une offensive pour presenter le contr le aerien comme seul responsable des retards
french il serait judicieux je crois de se pencher aussi beaucoup plus sur les probl mes de types d avions de types de flux d escales et de rotations et bien s r sur les probl mes qui persistent du c te de la defense
french j ai le sentiment qu on se lance dans une fuite en avant avec des solutions en apparence evidentes mais qui ne prennent pas en compte la specificite du contr le aerien
french m zimeray le disait tout l heure oui le trajet d un avion est morcele en espaces et plus le trafic est dense plus il y a de divisions en espaces
french pourquoi
french parce que la division en espaces c est la capacite humaine contr ler gerer un certain nombre d avions
french alors penser qu il y aurait trop de centres de contr les est mon avis une ineptie
french pourquoi alors ne pas dire qu il y a trop d avions
french il n y a pas non plus que je sache de points de blocage du contr le aerien specifiques aux zones de fronti re
french la grande proposition qui nous est faite pour ameliorer le trafic consiste separer les fonctions de regulation et de contr le
french mais quel est l inter t d une telle mesure
french qu il soit necessaire de reflechir des decoupages plus pertinents pourquoi pas
french mais ce n est pas cela qu on nous propose
french la separation des fonctions aboutirait liberaliser la fourniture des services du trafic aerien mettre en place comme le dit le rapport atkins d ailleurs un marche interieur liberalise
french le contr le aerien ce n est pas une compagnie aerienne ce n est pas un secteur marchand
french sa fonction premi re ne l oublions pas est d assurer la securite
french or je pense qu il est contraire la securite de placer les organismes de contr le ou de certification des appareils sous la pression des marches
french il faut donc preserver la capacite d investir dans de nouveaux outils technologiques dans la formation
french en france et je ne pretends pas en faire un mod le il existe une direction generale qui regit l ensemble et ces derni res annees il y a eu des investissements il y a eu embauche de contr leurs
french le syst me est performant
french au nom de quoi voulez vous casser
french le president retire la parole l orateur
french monsieur le president ce rapport part d une constatation evidente que les parlementaires europeens connaissent d ailleurs fort bien puisqu ils empruntent frequemment les transports aeriens le ciel est toujours plus encombre du fait de la demande croissante concernant le transport aerien
french cette surcharge d avions entra ne inevitablement une aggravation des retards dans le trafic aerien qui portent prejudice aux passagers aux entreprises aux affaires et au tourisme
french l instar du rapporteur nous considerons que les transports aeriens doivent tre envisages comme un syst me coherent d operateurs aeroports et services de contr le du trafic aerien dont les composants sont directement interdependants et que seule une analyse globale peut resoudre les probl mes de capacite de l espace aerien
french c est pourquoi nous saluons la creation du groupe de haut niveau compose de representants civils et militaires groupe place sous la presidence de mme la commissaire loyola de palacio et qui se consacre l etude de la question des retards des avions afin de minimiser les probl mes qu ils causent
french ce groupe devra presenter un rapport au conseil en temps opportun
french quant nous nous attendons de ce rapport definitif qu il se concentre sur l elaboration de propositions viables et de solutions concr tes realistes et efficaces en vue de resoudre le probl me des retards du trafic aerien en europe et qu il laisse tomber les suggestions polemiques qui ne contribuent pas du tout ou peu cet objectif comme la defense de la libre concurrence entre prestataires de services de gestion du trafic aerien
french en effet nous ne voyons pas quelle est la relation entre cette pretendue liberalisation et la question des retards qui doit tre reglee d urgence
french d autre part nous voulons que les solutions qui seront proposees respectent la souverainete nationale des etats membres en limitant la centralisation de l activite regulant les mati res strictement necessaires qu elles sauvegardent les exigences particuli res liees la defense et aux besoins militaires specifiques de chacun et qu elles respectent les engagements de tous au sein des organisations internationales
french cela ne signifie pas que les pays ne doivent pas assouplir le plus possible le transit d avions dans l espace aerien superieur et rechercher des formules d articulation plus efficaces avec les besoins operationnels de nature militaire
french l approfondissement du programme europeen de gestion aerienne dont la finalite consiste obtenir une compl te coordination et integration des syst mes atm l echelle europeenne doit aussi se poursuivre dans le cadre d eurocontrol puisque le probl me ne reside pas tant dans la division de l espace aerien qui peut tre justifiee du point de vue de l adequation du nombre d avions et de routes confies chaque contr leur mais bien dans l harmonisation technique des syst mes atm
french monsieur le president le rapport atkins est fort appreciable en ce qu il aborde un th me particuli rement delicat et dirais je extr mement technique mais le probl me est essentiellement politique
french j ai entendu parler d un nombre excessif d avions d un nombre excessif d avions confie un seul contr leur etc mais ici il suffit d observer le pays le plus avance dans le domaine de l aeronautique c est dire les etats unis d amerique o on s est attaque ces probl mes et o si on ne les a pas totalement resolus on a trouve des solutions appropriees
french il y a surtout un fait fondamental aux etats unis il n y a qu un seul contr le du trafic aerien en europe il y en a encore quinze du moins dans l union europeenne
french ajoutez y la suisse qui se trouve en plein milieu et les pays limitrophes et vous comprendrez pourquoi nous rencontrons tant de difficultes
french il est d s lors juste de souhaiter un contr le unique du trafic aerien au moins pour ce qui est de l union europeenne englobant pour des raisons techniques la confederation helvetique
french c est primordial et cela permettra avec le developpement des techniques de resoudre de nombreux probl mes dans ces techniques je pense aux syst mes tcas aux syst mes gps ou aux syst mes gnns qui aident la fluidite du trafic aerien
french je voudrais conclure en exprimant ma perplexite l encontre du principe de subsidiarite c est un principe essentiel mais pas toujours simple
french les r gles du transport et du trafic aeriens sont peut tre avec celles de la navigation maritime les plus internationales qui soient et il est de ce fait difficile d entrer dans les details
french derni re chose le rapport vise surtout les grands vecteurs que sont les compagnies aeriennes
french n oublions pas les autres utilisateurs de l espace aerien tels que les avions taxis les compagnies privees et les utilisateurs des avions des aero clubs
french monsieur le president madame la commissaire la conqu te d une place sur le marche des transports n est pas une sinecure
french surtout en presence d une concurrence exacerbee d une pression considerable d accords de cooperation internationaux et de postes de frais externes non negligeables
french telle est la situation laquelle le secteur de la navigation aerienne se trouve confronte
french c est pour ces raisons que nous devons penser l avenir du secteur
french selon moi la croissance illimitee ne doit pas tre acceptee en tant que donnee
french certes plusieurs flux de transport ne peuvent tre effectues que par voie aerienne mais d autres possibilites existent pour la majorite
french c est dans cette direction que nous devons orienter notre politique
french cela exige cependant d entamer une action de longue haleine et de consentir des investissements cibles et efficaces en mati re d alternatives
french nous n avons toutefois pas encore atteint ce stade et le developpement des reseaux transeuropeens conna t des resultats inegaux
french il est desormais temps de rechercher des solutions alternatives pour le court terme
french selon moi la solution la plus importante consiste mettre profit l espace disponible tant au niveau de l espace aerien que des appareils comme le precise le rapporteur cette demarche exige des mesures applicables au personnel et l organisation
french la creation d un ciel unique europeen fournira temporairement assez d espace pour concevoir partir de la configuration actuelle des mesures structurelles contre la croissance effrenee de la navigation aerienne
french c est ainsi que nous devons agir si nous voulons concretiser les ambitions d une politique durable en mati re de transports
french il ne suffit pas de faciliter les choses il faut aussi prendre les mesures de restriction qui s imposent
french pour le moment le rapporteur ouvre la voie de mani re appropriee veillons cependant ne pas nous reposer sur nos lauriers et continuons de reflechir l avenir du secteur des transports en general et de la navigation aerienne en particulier
french le rapport de m atkins traite d une question qui est peut tre la plus importante que mme de palacio et nous m mes en tant que parlementaires europeens ayons gerer dans les prochaines quatre ou cinq annees et il me faut tout d abord feliciter m atkins de l approche qu il adopte dans le rapport en question
french au del de cela de toute evidence le probl me est colossal
french les retards sur l ensemble des vols sont passes de en en
french jusqu en les vols vont quasiment doubler consequences des retards temps perdu dommages economiques saturation et par consequent risques pour la securite
french eurocontrol s est avere un mecanisme insuffisant pour gerer le trafic aerien
french dans ce cadre il est absolument necessaire que la vice presidente mme de palacio progresse avec determination ainsi qu elle l a fait jusqu present vers la mise en place d un ciel europeen veritablement unique
french les etats membres surmontant leur inquietude peut tre justifiee quant la gestion de leur espace aerien devront un moment donne voir quelques annees en avant au del de leurs fronti res et de la situation actuelle les besoins qui se creent
french il nous faut aller de l avant d s maintenant et regler les multiples details techniques comme par exemple les relations entre l aviation civile et l aviation militaire
french entre temps cependant les passagers devront tre dedommages en cas de retards des compagnies aeriennes et bien entendu tre informes de leurs droits
french je conclurai mon intervention en rappelant la prise de position du parlement europeen lors du vote du rapport relatif la conference intergouvernementale il soutenait que dans nos etats membres la fonction de regulation du trafic aerien en europe doit passer l union europeenne
french monsieur le president je remercie m atkins pour son rapport et pour la disposition dont il a fait preuve collaborer non seulement avec mon groupe mais egalement avec d autres groupes pour proposer ce document
french nul doute que les retards en mati re de contr le de trafic aerien constituent un probl me
french une visite n importe quel aeroport important cette epoque de l annee le confirmera
french je crois savoir que le retard moyen serait de minutes
french tout ce que mon experience me permet de dire c est que quelqu un doit particuli rement en vouloir manchester parce que je n ai jamais pris de vol sabena de bruxelles vers manchester ayant ne f t ce qu approche les vingt minutes de retard
french je peux dire avec certitude que l horaire ne constitue qu un guide et non quelque chose de definitif lorsqu il s agit de planifier un voyage
french il est clair que c est un probl me auquel nous devons nous attaquer
french le rapport doit envisager toutes les questions relatives au trafic aerien et adopter une approche double telle que proposee par la commission
french cependant tous les retards ne sont pas dus au contr le du trafic aerien
french l excuse la plus grossi re du monde utilisee par les compagnies aeriennes est de dire aux passagers que le retard est d au trafic aerien
french jamais les contr leurs du trafic aerien des aeroports ne disent le contraire
french franchement parler bon nombre des retards sont dus l inefficacite de certaines compagnies aeriennes elles m mes
french des passagers disparaissent
french je suis toujours etonne du nombre de passagers qui disparaissent dans les aeroports
french je me demande ce qu ils fabriquent
french ils provoquent invariablement autant de retards que le trafic aerien
french la question relative eurocontrol est importante
french nous soutenons le compromis contenu dans le point concernant eurocontrol
french nous soutenons egalement la necessite pour les militaires de ceder une partie de leur espace aerien
french pour conclure il y a quelques amendements issus du groupe tdi
french je suis particuli rement interesse par l amendement
french je ne peux que supposer que le groupe tdi doit
french le president retire la parole l orateur
french monsieur le president je voudrais moi aussi remercier le rapporteur pour son excellent rapport
french les experiences de lundi dernier confirment qu il s agit vraiment d un rapport tr s important
french plusieurs membres du parlement ont mis jusqu quinze heures pour gagner strasbourg
french des vols avaient ete annules et plusieurs vols avaient beaucoup de retard
french la situation est vraiment intenable l espace aerien est serieusement encombre les vols ont constamment du retard et les droits des passagers aeriens sont tout fait inexistants
french le rapport contient des mesures qui vont dans le bon sens et qui doivent tre appliquees sans tarder
french je ne crois certes pas qu elles soient suffisantes car on s attend un doublement du trafic aerien au cours des dix prochaines annees
french il faudra passer des vols courts aux chemins de fer pour disposer de la place pour les vols plus longs car il n existe gu re d alternative ces derniers
french les rapports qui visent l amelioration de la competitivite du trafic ferroviaire sont tr s importants de ce point de vue aussi
french la taxe environnementale prevue pour le trafic aerien devra aussi tre ponderee de fa on ne pas affecter demesurement les vols long courrier et encourager prendre le train pour les trajets courts
french monsieur le president madame la commissaire chers coll gues avec la mondialisation nous avons eu le plaisir de decouvrir que les avions en particulier pouvaient nous transporter de notre ville aux quatre coins du monde et nous aimons tellement cela que nous ne pouvons plus vivre sans prendre l avion
french mais tout comme nous avons decouvert la congestion automobile des villes nous constatons que l espace aerien est aujourd hui bien trop souvent congestionne les retards sont frequents nos valises sont perdues et nous devons subir toutes sortes de gr ves du z le et caract re syndical
french nous les usagers nous pensons qu il faut etablir et defendre nos droits et ameliorer la gestion des compagnies aeriennes des aeroports des horaires de vol et du contr le aerien
french mais bien souvent nous pensons egalement qu il faut que l ensemble des europeens partagent davantage leur souverainete aerienne et qu il existe une grande partie de l espace aerien reserve dont on ne tire pas les benefices sociaux que notre epoque exige
french il faut d s lors promouvoir outre la reforme d eurocontrol l augmentation du nombre de frequences radio et l application des meilleures technologies nouvelles en mati re de contr le afin d augmenter le nombre de couloirs aeriens et d avions en cette periode de stabilite il faut que l aviation commerciale civile puisse utiliser les espaces reserves surtout dans ses cotes d altitude les plus elevees lesquels habituellement ne sont pas souvent utilises par l armee
french les citoyens le demandent et je crois qu il est possible de trouver une solution parfaitement valable pour tous en partageant j insiste la souverainete et l espace reserve l aviation militaire
french monsieur le president madame la commissaire mesdames et messieurs l instar du rapporteur et des orateurs precedents je pense qu il est urgent de prendre les mesures appropriees en vue de s attaquer l augmentation constante des retards qui touchent le trafic aerien europeen et terme d y remedier
french la discussion en commission et aujourd hui en seance pleni re tourne toujours autour des moyens et methodes les plus appropries pour parvenir une modification de la gestion du trafic aerien
french sir atkins dont j apprecie particuli rement les competences professionnelles et une majorite de la commission de la politique regionale des transports et du tourisme pensent que cet objectif peut avant tout tre atteint par des mesures de liberalisation
french une liberalisation augmente incontestablement le nombre d entrepreneurs mais elle ne remedie pas certains probl mes et en cree m me de nouveaux
french premi rement tant que les etats membres placent leurs inter ts nationaux legitimes au dessus de ceux de l ensemble de l europe en ce qui concerne la coordination et l utilisation d un espace aerien europeen cela ne donnera lieu aucune modification fondamentale
french deuxi mement c est egalement une raison qui explique le manque d efficacite d eurocontrol
french peu importe que l on proc de une separation entre la regulation et la surveillance que vous liberalisiez ou privatisiez tant qu il n existe aucune volonte politique pour accepter que l espace aerien de l europe soit uniquement gere l echelle europeenne dix rapports supplementaires n y feront rien
french troisi mement l utilisation civile de l espace aerien doit avoir la priorite
french dans une europe unifiee pacifique il n existe aucune raison logique qui justifie qu une partie importante de l espace aerien soit encore reservee l armee
french quatri mement ne pensez vous pas non plus qu en faisant de la liberalisation un fetichisme la probabilite d une diminution des offres sur les destinations moins lucratives soit tr s elevee et qu il ne peut y avoir de concurrence loyale tant que nous n avons pas arr te des normes de securite coordonnees harmonisees et sociales
french cinqui mement nous n avons pas besoin d une influence de la commission sur les gouvernements nationaux en cas de conflits sociaux comme on l exige au point du rapport mais bien d un dialogue social fonctionnant au mieux entre tous les acteurs du trafic aerien
french monsieur le president le rapport de m atkins evoque un certain nombre de probl mes reels que pose l evolution du syst me aerien en europe
french la question de la securite d abord
french les conflits du travail qui perturbent parfois le trafic prennent en otage sans preavis serieux des milliers d usagers
french les retards de plus en plus nombreux et insupportables ne sont pas dus comme on l a signale dej seulement l encombrement du ciel aerien mais aussi la pretention des compagnies pour des imperatifs de rentabilite de faire effectuer leurs avions des rotations avec des delais d une bri vete excessive deraisonnable et en definitive impraticable
french le rapport n evoque cependant pas une question essentielle celle des droits de trafic
french l heure actuelle il est extr mement difficile une compagnie europeenne dont une ligne desservirait par exemple paris houston et san francisco de charger des passagers en californie parce que ceci est juridiquement considere comme du cabotage tandis qu une compagnie americaine qui dessert new york madrid paris peut elle embarquer des passagers en espagne pour les debarquer en europe
french c est dans la negociation internationale des droits de trafic que cette notion d espace aerien europeen x
french le president retire la parole l orateur
french monsieur le president on constate que le transport aerien est progressivement accessible un plus grand nombre de nos concitoyens
french cette democratisation est certes la bienvenue mais soul ve des questions importantes pour le futur accroissement du trafic engorgement des aeroports congestion du ciel et non respect de l environnement notamment en termes de nuisances phoniques
french la volonte de creer un trafic aerien optimal en europe part d un bon sentiment mais pourquoi la commission devrait elle remettre en cause les politiques aeriennes des etats membres et leurs accords bilateraux au moyen d un espace aerien unique
french bien entendu je souscris d une part l objectif de rationalisation des mouvements d avions et d autre part l objectif de recherche d une meilleure fluidite du trafic ceci dans le plein respect de la protection des consommateurs et de la securite des usagers
french j aimerais bien croire mme palacio lorsqu elle assure qu il n y a je cite aucune reference la mise en concurrence des services de contr le aerien ou leur privatisation dans les travaux de la commission
french mais alors les differents mouvements sociaux des personnels concernes seraient donc sans aucun fondement
french la commission reclame l av nement d une veritable autorite de gestion du trafic aerien qui soit une autorite reglementaire forte
french
french je dis non non une refonte compl te d eurocontrol non une nouvelle structure reglementaire son fonctionnement actuel organise avec efficacite tout compte fait et en particulier en mati re de securite un trafic equilibre en respectant les syst mes nationaux auxquels chaque etat doit pouvoir avoir droit non une representation par la commission des etats membres aux c tes des etats exterieurs annihilant de fait tout pouvoir de decision politique en mati re de transport aerien
french monsieur le president madame la vice presidente de la commission la communication de la commission et l excellent travail du rapporteur vont dans le sens du dernier conseil europeen de lisbonne o l on invitait la commission presenter dans les plus brefs delais une serie de propositions concr tes
french c est present le conseil qui devra prendre les decisions politiques necessaires et urgentes permettant d achever le marche unique de l aviation l aide d un syst me unique de contr le du trafic aerien
french la croissance de la demande se situe actuellement entre et par an et il est probable qu il en soit de m me au cours des prochaines annees ce qui complique encore plus le travail de syst mes europeens de gestion du trafic aerien qui se sont montres incapables de faire face un tel developpement et auxquels on doit plus de des retards bien qu il soit vrai qu il existe d autres causes comme les limites des aeroports et une programmation des vols ne tenant pas compte des limites des infrastructures
french une autre cause qui rend le syst me actuel inefficace est l organisation differente des syst mes civil et militaire ainsi que les differentes normes de materiel technique au sol
french l aviation generale l aviation commerciale et l aviation militaire doivent acceder l espace aerien dans les m mes conditions ce qui ne signifie pas qu il ne faille pas accorder la priorite et m me l exclusivite d acc s aux militaires en cas de crise
french mais le seul fait qu une crise puisse eclater ne justifie pas que certains etats membres maintiennent les normes en vigueur durant la guerre froide
french il est necessaire que les contr leurs civils et militaires des tours de contr le travaillent en etroite collaboration
french il est clairement necessaire d etablir une cooperation plus efficace entre les differentes utilisations de l espace et il me semble que cette cooperation ou point de vue commun doit emerger au niveau europeen
french je felicite le rapporteur et la vice presidente de la commission pour les points communs partages sur un probl me tellement important et sensible pour la vie quotidienne de nos citoyens
french le rapport de m atkins est detaille et equilibre il presente une position actuelle et correcte de notre parlement
french enfin madame la vice presidente sachez que nous sommes conscients de vos efforts et que nous vous soutiendrons dans la voie que vous avez empruntee
french monsieur le president j emets les plus grandes reserves l egard du rapport atkins parce qu il porte la marque d inter ts commerciaux qui avancent masques derri re les meilleures intentions du monde
french en realite les compagnies aeriennes souhaitent la liberalisation totale du contr le aerien non pas tant pour des raisons de securite d interoperabilite ou de reduction des retards que pour pouvoir acceder un marche des services de contr le qui permettrait aux plus puissantes d entre elles de se payer des creneaux chers mais securises et de laisser aux autres et l aviation privee le poids des retards
french en guise de ciel unique une telle liberalisation nous promettrait un ciel plusieurs vitesses
french je ne m explique pas autrement le proc s en sorcellerie qui est fait dans ce rapport aux seuls services de contr le civil
french nous savons tous qu ils ne representent que des retards ce qui merite certes d tre combattu mais depend pour l essentiel des servitudes militaires
french c est un probl me politique qui depend d abord des politiques
french nous savons tous que l augmentation considerable du trafic aerien est la cause tendancielle principale d encombrement et de saturation du ciel
french nous savons tous qu il faudrait demultiplier les pistes et les plates formes pour avoir quelque chance d obtenir une pause une simple pause dans la saturation
french enfin dans mon pays les compagnies aeriennes ont choisi de mettre en place des navettes qui envoient de chaque ville de province fran aise une douzaine d aeronefs de faible capacite tous les matins de h h sur la seule plate forme parisienne
french est ce la faute au contr le aerien si ledit contr le refuse qu ils atterrissent tous ensemble paris
french voil les causes essentielles des retards aeriens
french naturellement il faut instaurer le ciel unique travers eurocontrol reforme et des services de contr le harmonises l echelle europeenne
french mais je n imagine pas personnellement que des services de securite collective soient regentes par le seul profit sous contr le d actionnaires
french et je n imagine pas que le ciel unique europeen soit demain un ciel inegal entre compagnies aeriennes
french j esp re madame la commissaire que la commission dans la preparation de la future directive sur le ciel unique saura aborder cette question avec plus d impartialite de globalite et de serenite
french monsieur le president je me fais le relais de la protestation des contr leurs aeriens contre le projet de la commission europeenne qui derri re le slogan plaisant de ciel unique europeen ouvrira la voie la privatisation du contr le aerien
french le rapport atkins degage la voie la main mise de groupes prives lorgnant sur le contr le aerien qui avec l accroissement du trafic est susceptible de rapporter de l argent
french ce rapport evoque les retards qui seraient de plus en plus frequents
french mais en quoi le fait de soumettre le contr le aerien aux exigences du profit prive pourrait il mettre fin aux retards
french c est precisement la course au profit des compagnies aeriennes qui les conduit des choix entra nant ces retards
french il est de l inter t des usagers et de leur securite comme de l inter t des travailleurs de ce secteur que le contr le aerien reste un service public avec la vocation exclusive d assurer le bon deroulement du trafic aerien
french la concurrence la recherche du profit dans un domaine aussi sensible que le contr le aerien conduiront inevitablement des catastrophes
french s il est necessaire de mettre fin aux particularismes nationaux en mati re de gestion du trafic aerien et legitime d unifier l espace aerien europeen cela doit se faire en recusant toute idee de privatisation de concurrence de recherche de rentabilite et nous voterons contre ce rapport
french monsieur le president je me dois vraiment de feliciter mon coll gue sir robert atkins membre du parti conservateur britannique pour l excellence de son rapport sur le ciel unique europeen
french cela demontre sans aucun doute que l ambition globale de l union europeen est une nation unique avec son drapeau unique son hymne national unique son espace juridique unique ses fronti res nationales uniques et maintenant les citoyens de l europe seront bient t en mesure de respirer de l air europeen unique
french toutefois apr s l echec de la politique de la terre unique connue sous le nom de pac la politique de la mer unique la pcp nous nous attendons avec impatience l echec similaire de la politique du ciel unique
french en particulier etant donne le nombre de gr ves chez les contr leurs du trafic aerien je suppose que nous pouvons present nous attendre la gr ve unique europeenne
french mais vous avez apporte de l eau au moulin du mouvement eurosceptique en grande bretagne sir robert je vous en felicite
french monsieur le president il est tout fait vrai de dire que le probl me des retards du trafic aeriens doit tre aborde de mani re urgente
french toutefois il convient egalement de noter que des retards de gestion de l espace et du trafic aerien enregistres entre janvier et juin etaient principalement dus des reductions temporaires de capacite associees notamment la crise du kosovo
french le probl me reel se situe dans les zones cheval sur le nord et le sud qui incluent la suisse la france l italie l espagne des parties de l allemagne ainsi que l espace aerien superieur de maastricht celles ci sont responsable de des retards de gestion du flux de trafic aerien et de goulots d etranglement
french un moment donne la gr ce faisait partie du probl me
french cependant les resultats impressionnants des grecs demontrent que des ameliorations sont possibles si des actions energiques sont mises en x uvre et si les gouvernements nationaux coop rent reellement entre eux
french trop souvent eurocontrol fait office de bouc emissaire et est accuse d avoir provoque la situation actuelle mais les veritables reproches doivent tre adresses aux gouvernements nationaux pour leur inaction dans les domaines que j ai evoques
french il est evident que le conseil transports europeens doit prendre des mesures immediates afin de garantir que les decisions relatives au contr le du trafic aerien soient appliquees par tous les etats membres partout en europe
french il convient de garder l esprit qu eurocontrol est la seule institution paneuropeenne dans le domaine de la gestion du trafic aerien et qu elle doit recevoir notre soutien
french pour conclure la question evoquee du manque critique de personnel chiffre qui s el ve contr leurs aeriens dans toute l europe doit tre abordee de mani re urgente par les gouvernements nationaux
french en soi cela contribuera largement l amelioration du flux du trafic aerien
french en outre les aeroports et les compagnies aeriennes doivent examiner minutieusement leurs pratiques etant donne qu eux aussi ils sont bien trop souvent responsables du haut pourcentage de retards subis
french monsieur le president permettez moi de commencer par dire merci au rapporteur atkins pour son action energique la commission pour avoir fait de cette question une de ses priorites ainsi qu au commissaire responsable de palacio pour avoir ose passer de la parole l action
french gr ce eux la question d un contr le aerien commun court terme est plus proche d une solution que sans doute jamais auparavant
french il est vrai qu il reste beaucoup faire
french avant toute chose il faut convaincre tous les etats membres qui y sont opposes et c est justement la raison pour laquelle il est de la plus haute importance que le parlement europeen soutienne aujourd hui totalement la commission dans le travail poursuivi
french nous nous trouvons au beau milieu d un autre ete chaotique dans les airs
french l evolution laquelle nous assistons l heure actuelle conduira une multiplication par deux du trafic aerien d ici les annees suivant
french cela suppose la prise de decisions politiques urgentes
french autrement nous courons le risque que l engorgement de l espace aerien dans le futur n entra ne pas seulement des retards de quinze trente ou soixante minutes chose que nous pouvons eventuellement accepter mais nous risquons de ne plus tre convaincus de regler la securite
french nous ne devons jamais permettre cela
french c est dans cette perspective que le rapport de m atkins et l action de la commission doivent tre envisages
french l ue a consacre beaucoup de temps et d energie demanteler les fronti res et creer un marche interieur
french tous ceux qui voyagent dans les airs ce que nous faisons assez souvent s aper oivent toutefois qu il y a encore des fronti res partout
french le rapport fixe un calendrier particuli rement serre
french je partage cette ambition
french veillons ensemble ce que l ete soit le dernier ete chaotique dans le ciel surplombant l europe
french la commission peut sans aucun doute atteindre cet objectif en s appuyant sur le rapport atkins
french monsieur le president madame la vice presidente de la commission mesdames et messieurs rien n est plus actuel que ce rapport
french juste avant la pause estivale alors que tout le monde part en vacances et que de plus en plus de gens utilisent l avion le parlement aborde les questions relatives au transport aerien
french il s agit l d un th me deplaisant comme nous le savons tous c est ce que doivent ressentir tous les passagers
french il s agit des retards qui durent souvent plusieurs heures et dont nous souffrons tous
french le fait de voir des passagers ennuyes enerves voire agressifs remplir les couloirs est dej une image quotidienne dans les aeroports en tant que parlementaires nous endurons encore davantage cette situation
french pendant les vacances c est egalement ce qu endurent de larges parties de la population
french je voudrais encore rappeler un aspect important
french cette question ne concerne pas uniquement les nombreuses difficultes personnelles liees l emploi du temps des passagers mais egalement les frais supplementaires en keros ne ainsi que les pollutions provoquees lorsque les avions ne peuvent pas atterrir dans les delais
french c est pourquoi je salue le fait que la commission ait presente un rapport sur ces probl mes importants et qu elle ait mis contribution le groupe de haut niveau qui est en charge de ces probl mes et de la creation d un ciel unique europeen
french j esp re qu en automne nous recevrons les resultats definitifs de l enqu te afin de pouvoir realiser des avancees concr tes en collaboration avec la commission
french la securite pour tous les passagers mais surtout pour les passagers frequents constitue un aspect prioritaire
french les normes de securite ne peuvent en aucun cas tre menacees
french c est la raison pour laquelle les espaces aeriens doivent tre contr les et proteges au mieux
french eurocontrol doit satisfaire aux exigences en mati re de securite mais il convient egalement de creer l environnement necessaire pour atteindre cet objectif
french merci beaucoup madame la commissaire
french le debat est clos
french le vote aura lieu aujourd hui heures
french securite et sante des travailleuses enceintes au travail
french l ordre du jour appelle le rapport a de mme dami o au nom de la commission de l emploi et des affaires sociales sur le rapport de la commission sur la transposition de la directive cee du conseil du octobre concernant la mise en x uvre de mesures visant promouvoir l amelioration de la securite et de la sante des travailleuses enceintes accouchees ou allaitantes au travail com c cos
french monsieur le president je consid re que l instrument legislatif que nous analysons aujourd hui dans le rapport d evaluation envoye par la commission a acheve son parcours en ce qui concerne les droits contractuels et les syst mes de securite sociale
french bien que des milliers de travailleurs de pays de l union europeenne en ont beneficie il s av re cependant depasse
french il est depasse parce que la convention de l oit qui date de vient d tre revisee et que la plupart des pays du monde devrait ameliorer substantiellement la protection de la maternite
french on attendait bien s r de l union et on attend toujours d elle qu elle reste socialement plus avancee dans cette mati re comme dans d autres
french mais tout n est pas depasse puisqu en mati re d organisation du travail la transposition de la directive s est averee imparfaite et sa mise en x uvre encore plus
french la plupart des pays ne respecte pas les trois phases de l organisation du poste de travail changement de poste de travail en ce qui concerne les travaux risque changement de travailleuse et seulement apr s un conge de maladie qui reduit les revenus de la travailleuse ainsi que ses perspectives de carri re
french je dirais par exemple que certains pays ne respectent m me pas une periode minimale de recuperation de la m re dont les specialistes disent qu elle est de jours pour un accouchement normal un poste de travail normal
french il y a donc des pays qui ne respectent pas ces r gles sous pretexte de garantir une option pour les femmes
french nous pensons qu il faut garantir aux femmes l option de jouir d un bon conge de maternite partager avec le p re mais que le conge en ce qui concerne le risque pour leur propre sante doit tre evalue et garanti
french par ailleurs l evaluation des risques n est pas articulee dans cette directive avec les autres specialement avec la directive cadre sur l evaluation des risques et l information des travailleurs
french elle n est pas articulee et elle fait retomber sur l emploi des femmes un anath me injuste selon lequel les risques de la maternite s appliquent exclusivement aux jeunes en ge de procreer
french ces risques sont reellement sous evalues et ne doivent pas retomber sur l employeur ou constituer une obligation pour l employeur uniquement lorsque le medecin informe l employeur de l etat dans lequel se trouve la travailleuse
french premi rement parce que c est trop tard les risques de radiation des milieux chimiques et des positions imparfaites produisent leurs consequences nefastes pour la sante de la femme et du f x tus au cours des premi res semaines
french deuxi mement parce qu ils ne prot gent pas la sante genesique des hommes et des femmes alors que l etendue du probl me de la sterilite est dej appreciable aujourd hui dans l union plus de des foyers europeens sont concernes cause des styles de vie engendres par notre organisation economique et aussi du fait qu elle n offre pas de protection contre ces dangers je prendrais pour exemple les temperatures extr mes l origine de la sterilite feminine et masculine
french il serait bon que l union qui reunit aujourd hui les conditions elabore et applique une legislation dans ce sens
french quant au conge nous connaissons les co ts que son extension entra ne pour l activite economique et nous savons qu ils sont bien plus eleves pour l emploi des femmes
french mais nous savons aussi que les techniciens de la sante recommandent cinq mois au minimum pour que l enfant reste la maison protege du monde exterieur et surtout qu il grandisse dans un environnement psychoaffectif favorable qui lui apporte l equilibre necessaire sa croissance en toute securite car il a besoin de ses parents
french ce conge doit tre etendu et offert aux deux geniteurs dans un partage sain
french je dirais encore que la directive doit envisager aussi l economie informelle et les contrats de travail atypiques
french enfin la commission nous dira j esp re ce qu elle entend faire ce sujet maintenant qu elle tient une base juridique etendue avec l article au lieu de l ancien article qui lui permet de repondre en toute securite d autres aspects auxquels le rapport fait reference
french monsieur le president chers coll gues mme dami o a redige un tr s bon rapport et y a bien integre l avis que j ai rendu pour la commission des droits de la femme et de l egalite des chances
french l amelioration de la securite et de la sante des femmes enceintes accouchees ou allaitantes au travail est pour toutes ces personnes d une importance toute particuli re tant pour la protection de la femme que pour celle de l enfant avant la naissance
french il s agit d un th me general de societe et il convient d s lors de l aborder de mani re consciencieuse
french le rapport de la commission relatif la directive de traite uniquement de la transposition technique de la directive et n aborde pas la modification partielle des situations d emploi ainsi que l evolution du r le de la femme dans la societe
french le nombre de familles monoparentales a change et les femmes tendent de plus en plus l independance economique
french la commission doit presenter une proposition de modification de la directive dans laquelle toutes ces evolutions sont prises en compte et ce aussit t que possible c est dire avant la fin de cette annee
french il subsiste un besoin important d amelioration de la legislation
french cela vaut pour les mesures preventives relatives la sante sur le lieu de travail tant pour les femmes que pour les enfants avant la naissance
french il convient d eviter tout risque
french sauf exception les activites dangereuses pour la sante doivent tre interdites
french les temps prevus pour l allaitement doivent tre reglementes et l allaitement sur le lieu de travail doit tre rendu possible
french le conge de maternite apr s la naissance devrait tre de huit semaines au minimum
french l aide financi re doit tre reglementee clairement tant pour la duree du conge de maternite qu apr s l accouchement
french la question de la reprise du travail necessite egalement quelques clarifications
french toutes les reglementations necessaires ne peuvent en aucun cas provoquer un handicap elles ne peuvent pas non plus diminuer les chances des femmes sur le marche du travail
french monsieur le president chers coll gues la directive cee du conseil datant du octobre dont nous debattons aujourd hui de l execution est une des plus importantes dans le domaine de la protection technique et sanitaire des travailleuses et travailleurs
french je me rappelle encore tr s bien son elaboration et les probl mes dont nous avons autrefois discute
french il est positif de constater que malgre le differend sur la base juridique nous avons cette epoque reconnu son importance pour les travailleuses dans le marche interieur et que nous avons accompli un premier pas en vue d etablir des normes minimales pour la protection des travailleuses enceintes et des jeunes m res
french le rapport de la commission dont il est question aujourd hui continue de montrer des insuffisances en ce qui concerne l application de la directive et doit par consequent renforcer nos efforts en vue d assurer legalement et effectivement la protection des femmes au cours d une periode particuli re de leur existence
french il est en effet regrettable pour une societe de devoir constater que ce domaine precis necessite une attention accrue de notre part
french c est la raison pour laquelle je soutiens l approche visant reviser au plus vite la directive
french nous n y parviendrons cependant pas avant la fin de l annee
french certaines des exigences qui doivent figurer dans la proposition de modification de la directive sont reprises dans les propositions d amendement dont il est question et auxquelles le groupe ppe peut partiellement donner suite
french cela concerne en premier lieu la demande d une interdiction stricte de licenciement au cours des conges de maternite et la garantie que les femmes retrouvent la fin de ces conges leur ancien emploi ou un emploi comparable et que les atteintes cette pri re seront sanctionnees efficacement
french toute autre situation impliquerait une sanction pour les femmes qui veulent ou doivent negocier les conditions de leur activite et de leur maternite voire un desavantage injustifie dans leur vie professionnelle et privee
french envisagee de cette mani re la protection efficace des travailleuses enceintes et des jeunes m res constitue une des contributions les plus importantes une politique familiale active
french au regard de l elargissement l est et de la protection dans ces pays je voudrais faire remarquer que le marche interieur ne peut en rien se developper au detriment des femmes enceintes et des jeunes m res
french monsieur le president madame la commissaire je commencerai par remercier le rapporteur pour son travail approfondi serieux et courageux
french nous parlons d un sujet fort sensible en relation etroite avec des probl mes qui reviennent reguli rement l avant plan comme le vieillissement de la population le developpement demographique le faible taux de natalite le droit la sante le droit au travail le droit la maternite ou la valeur sociale de la maternite qui ne peut rester un probl me individuel de la femme mais qui doit trouver une protection et un soutien au sein de la societe
french la directive de dont nous evaluons aujourd hui l application dans les etats membres a justement pour objectif d etablir des mesures minimales pour promouvoir la securite et la sante sur le lieu de travail des travailleuses enceintes et allaitantes
french le rapport d evaluation de la commission montre que la directive s est averee utile qu elle a ameliore dans plusieurs etats membres certains aspects du probl me tels que les conges pour raisons de sante et de securite etc ces considerations de caract re general mises part nous partageons l avis critique du rapporteur sur l evaluation de la commission
french ce rapport est presente en retard par rapport au calendrier etabli et il se penche presque exclusivement sur les aspects juridiques et techniques
french il manque en effet des statistiques et des donnees concr tes sur les points vitaux de la directive comme la verification de l evaluation des risques sur le lieu de travail pour les femmes enceintes la frequences des accidents et des maladies professionnelles il manque des informations satisfaisantes sur la coordination de l adequation reglementaire des inspections de specialistes des sanctions infligees des recherches scientifiques visant determiner prevenir eliminer indemniser les risques professionnels
french il n y a pas eu nous semble t il de contr le serieux de la part de la commission il n y a pas eu de coordination entre l unite de la sante et de la securite et celle de l egalite des chances ce qui a laisse ressortir l ambigu te que la directive presente de ce point de vue
french le retard du dep t d un rapport d evaluation je rappellerai qu en raison du faible niveau des normes minimales prevues on n a obtenu l assentiment de l italie qu en echange d un engagement d une revision rapide aurait d deboucher sur une proposition de la commission dans le sens d une revision de la directive en particulier sur certains aspects que le rapporteur a rappeles la duree du conge de maternite la prolongation du conge de maternite dans les situations risques une definition plus precise du concept d indemnite adequate l interdiction du licenciement pendant la grossesse et le conge de maternite assortie de sanctions efficaces l interdiction de toute forme de discrimination en ce qui concerne les parcours professionnels et l amelioration des conditions de travail la prise de toutes les mesures necessaires pour proteger la sante et la securite de la m re et du f x tus sans prejudice pour le droit au travail et la carri re professionnelle et la promotion de l allaitement maternel par le biais de mesures diversifiees
french eu egard toutes les compatibilites necessaires ce qui devrait inspirer commission et les etats membres c est le principe de non discrimination et la reconnaissance de la maternite et de la paternite comme des droits fondamentaux et essentiels l equilibre de la societe
french il est important monsieur le president que les femmes puissent beneficier de cadres favorables et s rs en periode de grossesse et d accouchement afin que la m re et l enfant puissent demarrer sur de bonnes bases et il est aussi important que la grossesse et la maternite ne constituent pas un obstacle pour les femmes sur le marche de l emploi
french nous disposons d une directive datant de et etablissant des droits minimums en mati re de conge de maternite et d indemnites financi res dont peuvent beneficier les femmes lorsqu une maternite les eloigne du marche du travail
french la commission vient de passer en revue l application de cette directive dans les etats membres et le rapport de mme dami o souligne tr s justement que le rapport de la commission se limite faire un releve technique et factuel de l application de la directive sans evaluer dans quelle mesure elle offre concr tement aux femmes enceintes ou aux femmes qui viennent d accoucher de meilleures conditions
french le rapporteur estime donc que le rapport de la commission ne donne pas une base suffisante pour reviser la directive
french je partage totalement l avis du rapporteur sur ce point
french c est pourquoi je suis egalement opposee toute demande actuelle de revision de la directive
french je ne pense pas que nous devions exiger une proposition de nouvelle directive qui confererait le droit de plus longs conges obligatoires et qui contiendrait des exigences plus detaillees en mati re d indemnites financi res sans prendre d ment en consideration les differences existant dans les syst mes sociaux des etats membres
french les r gles actuelles presentent une grande flexibilite et la plupart des pays garantissent aux femmes de meilleures conditions que les r gles communes
french on peut se demander si de nouvelles r gles auraient vraiment un impact concret
french le conge de maternite et l octroi d une aide financi re constituent dans tous les cas une priorite relevant de la competence de chaque etat
french je pense par contre qu il serait bon de disposer d un meilleur aper u de la situation concr te dans les differents pays afin que les gouvernements puissent s echanger leurs experiences bonnes et mauvaises et ainsi s inspirer mutuellement
french monsieur le president chers coll gues la commission europeenne devra introduire fin une proposition de directive impliquant des mesures destinees aux travailleuses enceintes accouchees et allaitantes au travail
french l evaluation des mesures existantes accuse dej quatre ans de retard et ne repond pas aux exigences posees l epoque par le parlement europeen cette evaluation avait pour objectif d operer une modification
french le groupe des verts alliance libre europeenne souhaite l elargissement de la protection
french le rapport fait surtout mention de points institutionnels
french nous estimons qu il faut y ajouter le droit en vertu duquel l employee doit occuper la m me fonction ou une fonction equivalente apr s son conge de maternite
french nous demandons une extension des droits de la femme enceinte et allaitante
french en pratique il est frequent que les femmes fassent l objet d une discrimination pendant cette periode et ce malgre les droits dont elles beneficient en theorie
french c est pourquoi nous reclamons un renversement de la charge de la preuve
french l employeur devra ainsi demontrer que le licenciement ou le changement de situation n est pas consecutif la grossesse de l employee
french enfin nous voudrions demander la commission d expliquer pourquoi les etats membres n ont pas adopte le m me point de vue lors de la derni re assemblee de l oit
french pour quelles raisons le royaume uni s est il abstenu lors du vote final une attitude qui etant donne la procedure en vigueur equivaut voter contre
french pour conclure nous voudrions remercier madame dami o pour le travail qu elle a accompli
french monsieur le president l heure o l europe souligne avec la reunion de pekin new york son r le pionnier pour la mise en x uvre du principe d egalite entre les femmes et les hommes il appara t tout aussi important de garantir leur liberte
french cette liberte passe par un droit de protection specifique des femmes droit toujours lie leur corps notamment avec la maternite plus precisement avec la grossesse
french nous nous felicitons donc de l excellent rapport de mme dami o qui souligne l urgence de reviser la directive de
french sa demande d interdiction formelle des licenciements pendant la grossesse est fondamentale et je m arr terai uniquement sur ce point
french il me para t dangereux de laisser l employeur une marge de man x uvre en la mati re qu il saura toujours utiliser son profit
french aujourd hui avec la revision de la convention l oit nivelle par le bas la protection de la femme enceinte en acceptant certains licenciements dits sans rapport avec la grossesse
french l europe avec le rapport de mme dami o et la revision de la directive se doit d tre une reference politique pour les droits des femmes du monde entier
french monsieur le president chers coll gues je commencerais par feliciter notre coll gue elisa dami o pour son magnifique travail l occasion de ce rapport auquel nous avons tous contribue avec plaisir en commission non seulement en le soutenant enti rement mais aussi en introduisant certains amendements qui ont ete inclus dans la version definitive
french l adoption de ce rapport represente pour nous un moment important la fin de cette session legislative pour quatre raisons fondamentales
french premi rement parce qu il est inacceptable que la femme soit socialement penalisee ou discriminee pour cause de grossesse et de maternite
french deuxi mement parce que nous devons nous consacrer de mani re plus vigoureuse aux probl mes des risques pour la sante de la m re et de l enfant qui decoulent des conditions d exercice du travail
french troisi mement parce que dans la societe moderne le th me de la conciliation entre la vie personnelle et l activite professionnelle entre la famille et le travail est toujours plus important pour ceux qui comme nous se preoccupent de la realite des personnes
french il s agit justement d une des mati res essentielles pour laquelle cette conciliation doit avoir lieu de mani re responsable
french quatri mement parce que les politiques de maternite doivent tre coherentes avec les politiques de la famille et de la natalite en general et surtout au moment o la crise du vieillissement de la population europeenne necessite l attention croissante des etats membres
french nous allons debattre ici aussi de certains amendements notre position doit s inspirer de l equilibre de ce rapport
french c est pourquoi nous ne soutenons pas tous les amendements car nous estimons que l equilibre du rapport est meilleur que certains pas suggeres par les amendements
french nous soutiendrons les amendements proposes par nos coll gues conservateurs britanniques par notre coll gue bushill matthews qui attire l attention sur la question des petites et moyennes entreprises qui doivent tre prises en consideration dans la reglementation la fois au niveau communautaire et national
french mais en contrepartie nous souhaiterions que les conservateurs britanniques soutiennent le rapport car s il est vrai que certaines conclusions de la presidence portugaise attirent l attention sur ce point je voudrais souligner que dans le texte final du sommet de feira on insiste au paragraphe sur l importance de la responsabilite sociale des entreprises
french or pour nous democrates chretiens et conservateurs portugais c est un th me tr s important nous pensons que les entreprises ont egalement une responsabilite sociale qui doit tre developpee
french il me reste ajouter que nous sollicitons des votes separes pour ameliorer le rapport sur les points qui ont donne lieu quelques extravagances
french nos yeux la grossesse n est pas une ressource sociale nous sollicitons aussi le vote separe sur un autre point pour ameliorer le rapport
french enfin je lance un appel tous les democrates chretiens afin qu ils soutiennent le rapport de ma coll gue socialiste
french monsieur le president je voudrais d emblee regretter l incurie de la commission qui n a rien fait jusqu ce jour en vue de la revision de l evaluation et de la notification de la directive sur la protection de la maternite
french malgre les prejudices importants pour les femmes m res decoulant de cette omission quelque chose malheur est bon et ce rapport brillant de notre coll gue elisa dami o en est la demonstration car il permet au parlement europeen d aller plus loin
french ce rapport clarifie des concepts harmonise des normes au niveau communautaire cree des responsabilites partagees prend en consideration de nouveaux risques de l organisation actuelle du travail fournit des aides la croissance demographique dans une europe vieillissante et consid re la grossesse comme un etat naturel de la m re qui doit tre respecte et protege
french il consigne expressement les droits des travailleuses independantes et du teletravail il insiste sur les preoccupations accrues concernant les familles monoparentales toujours plus nombreuses en europe
french l objectif de l extension des conges de maternite vingt semaines est un objectif ambitieux et techniquement recommande qui doit tre mis en pratique progressivement et auquel nous devons nous preparer economiquement en repartissant les responsabilites de mani re solidaire entre les etats les entites patronales et syndicales
french pour la poursuite des fins proposees il est encore essentiel d encourager un dialogue une interconnexion et une articulation meilleurs entre les techniciens de la sante et ceux de l hygi ne et de la securite sur les lieux de travail afin d aboutir un environnement de travail meilleur pour la femme enceinte
french en ce qui concerne les pays candidats l adhesion la communaute europeenne doit s efforcer d obtenir leur solidarite pour adopter le plus vite possible les mesures preconisees par ce rapport car les resistances pourraient s averer ici plus nombreuses et difficiles surmonter
french enfin je voudrais tirer la sonnette d alarme sur le point de ce rapport car les mesures protegeant les femmes dans leur maternite comme les tr s longs conges pour accouchement peuvent avoir des effets pervers les employeurs n ayant pas avantage engager des femmes et preferant embaucher des hommes
french la commission doit donc mettre en place un syst me de detection des fraudes et d application de penalites lourdes concernant les entreprises qui op rent ce type de discrimination
french monsieur le president adopter une directive ne signifie pas necessairement que la realite soit telle que nous le souhaitons
french nous en avons ici un bon exemple
french selon l evaluation faite par la commission la situation des femmes enceintes en mati re de securite et de sante semble tr s bonne mais la realite est elle la m me que sur papier
french je n en suis pas si s re
french les rythmes de travail n ont jamais ete aussi eleves l efficacite doit tre maximale et les femmes enceintes doivent travailler comme si elles ne l etaient pas
french cela engendre du stress ce qui est nefaste pour la femme enceinte comme pour le f x tus
french nous le savons car des etudes le demontrent
french le parlement europeen en tant que legislateur et les deputes en tant que representants de la population ont le droit de savoir si la legislation que nous adoptons fonctionne aussi sur le plan pratique
french cet exemple montre selon moi les lacunes de la commission dans ce domaine
french le parlement doit donc lancer un message la commission selon lequel le travail realise n est pas suffisant
french il doit tre remanie
french nous devons savoir si la legislation fonctionne
french les analyses purement juridiques effectuees par la commission montrent dej la necessite d offrir une meilleure protection
french nous devons absolument disposer d une meilleure definition de la notion de prestation adequate et nous devons disposer de r gles plus strictes en mati re de licenciement en periode de grossesse
french la commission doit se remettre au travail et presenter les propositions requises
french le mod le social europeen se caracterise par un niveau de protection eleve
french cela doit tre un domaine et cette remarque s adresse au groupe liberal dont le point de vue est totalement different propos duquel l ue doit avoir une grande influence
french ce domaine ne peut tre confie la competence des differents etats membres
french la participation des femmes au marche de l emploi constitue un facteur qui determine la possibilite d atteindre les objectifs ambitieux que nous nous sommes fixes en mati re d emploi et de modernisation du mod le social europeen
french ce domaine doit donc faire l objet d une modernisation et des actions doivent tre menees
french on ne peut confier ce secteur la competence des etats membres l europe doit s en occuper conjointement
french monsieur le president nombreuses sont les femmes qui font actuellement l objet de discrimination sur leur lieu de travail
french nous savons que beaucoup d entre elles perdent leur emploi alors qu elles sont enceintes
french c est tout fait inacceptable
french le rapport dami o comporte beaucoup de bonnes propositions mais les liberaux suedois ont neanmoins des objections fondamentales l encontre du rapport
french je voudrais dire mon predecesseur qui s est exprime ici tout recemment que nous devrions nous interroger plus souvent au sein de ce parlement au fond de quoi doit s occuper le parlement europeen
french jusqu o devons nous aller
french nous croyons au principe de subsidiarite selon lequel les decisions doivent tre prises le plus pr s possible de l interesse
french la politique sociale est un domaine dans lequel l ue doit avoir une competence limitee en dehors de ce qui concerne la libre circulation des citoyens dans l union
french chaque etat membre doit avoir l enti re responsabilite et le droit de decider lui m me de son syst me de securite sociale
french le conge de maternite et les allocations familiales sont des exemples de probl mes qui ne sont pas directement transfrontaliers
french nous ne croyons pas en une legislation commune detaillee
french cela n emp che toutefois pas les etats membres de collaborer et d echanger des idees dans le domaine social
french le rapport dami o demande legitimement la promotion de la securite des travailleuses dans toute l europe une meilleure mobilite et un meilleur fonctionnement du marche interieur ainsi qu un droit de decision national sur les details dans le syst me politico social
french ce propos le rapport presente un desequilibre
french ma derni re question est le suivante pourquoi le parlement europeen devrait il decider que toutes les femmes de l union europeenne doivent avoir un conge de huit semaines apr s la naissance de l enfant
french je connais plusieurs femmes qui ont repris le travail plus t t la liberte de choix doit subsister
french monsieur le president mme elisa dami o responsable de ce rapport a raison de critiquer la commission pour le retard pris dans le processus de revision de la directive actuelle
french il est juste que le rapport regrette que la commission n ait pas respecte le calendrier defini par la directive et qu il n y ait pas eu d evaluation de l efficacite de sa pratique en insistant sur la necessite d une proposition de revision urgente en ce qui concerne l inclusion de differentes mesures que nous soutenons pour l essentiel et avec lesquelles nous sommes d accord
french de plus au cours du debat en commissions parlementaires nous avons presente plusieurs propositions visant garantir le droit obligatoire des pauses durant le travail pour l allaitement de non discrimination des femmes enceintes accouchees ou allaitantes sur les lieux de travail notamment en termes salariaux de progression de carri re d emploi en attirant particuli rement l attention sur la situation des travailleuses sous contrats duree determinee ou atypiques
french d une mani re generale les propositions ont ete acceptees l exception de celle concernant le paiement de la prestation pendant la suspension de l activite et le conge de maternite qui doit correspondre du salaire anterieur et tre pris en consideration pour les effets de l acquisition des droits la retraite
french j esp re que le parlement approuvera cette proposition
french monsieur le president si l intention de la commission etait d ameliorer effectivement la securite et la sante des travailleuses enceintes ou accouchees nous pouvons dire qu elle a manque son objectif
french on compte en effet deux lacunes evidentes dans son rapport le retard et le caract re limite
french le rapport aurait d tre presente d s mais quitte tre tardif il aurait au moins pu remedier la formulation peu claire de certains articles de la directive et definir les innombrables concepts flous qui ont suscite de multiples interpretations
french sans parler parmi les diverses donnees manquantes des resultats des questionnaires envoyes aux etats membres et des resultats de la coordination legislative et des activites afferentes du centre europeen de normalisation
french d s le parlement europeen jugeait necessaire de reexaminer cette directive c est pourquoi aujourd hui vu la necessite d une economie sociale de marche on partage les objectifs du rapport de mme dami o lier les politiques en mati re de maternite la politique de la famille et eliminer les flous en assurant l amelioration concr te et quantifiee des droits des travailleuses enceintes et accouchees
french monsieur le president madame la vice presidente de la commission l integration de la femme dans le marche du travail est tel qu un moment donne de sa vie professionnelle lorsqu elle tombe enceinte celle ci doit parfois prendre des conges supplementaires pour ne pas mettre en peril sa sante et celle de l enfant qu elle porte
french la grossesse est un etat naturel chez la femme que la societe doit respecter defendre et proteger
french la societe doit particuli rement proteger les travailleuses en leur garantissant leur poste de travail
french l integration de la femme dans le monde du travail est une realite que l on ne peut pas remettre en question et il ne faut pas mettre les femmes dans une situation o elles sont obligees de choisir entre avoir des enfants ou garder son emploi en raison des complications qu une grossesse pourrait occasionner
french le vieillissement de la population conjugue au faible taux de natalite de l union europeenne rend ce sujet extr mement important pour tous les partenaires sociaux
french il est tout aussi important de proteger la femme enceinte que de lui permettre d allaiter ce qui est bon pour la sante de la m re et de l enfant
french proteger la maternite et l allaitement ne peut pas tre considere comme une inegalite entre homme et femme car la maternite est exclusive aux femmes et c est la femme qu il faut proteger bien que les hommes puissent beneficier d une partie des conges parentaux
french les etats membres doivent assumer les inconvenients eventuels de cette directive en permettant aux patrons d offrir aux jeunes femmes des contrats de travail en les exemptant de charges sociales durant le conge de maternite
french la directive doit inclure un conge minimum de semaines assorti d une periode obligatoire d au moins huit semaines apr s l accouchement
french il faut garantir un salaire minimum equivalent sans perte des droits pension
french l interdiction des licenciements durant la grossesse doit tre applique la lettre
french la grossesse ne doit en aucun cas tre une cause de discrimination de la femme
french la commission des droits de la femme denonce l unanimite dans son avis le retard de l intervention de la commission ce qui est d autant plus grave si l on prend en consideration que cette periode s etend de la periode qui a connu les plus grands changements dans l acc s de la femme au monde du travail
french par ailleurs nous pensons que les deficiences de cette legislation risque d entra ner un phenom ne tr s grave savoir la desaffection l egard de la maternite chez les jeunes
french nous invitons la commission presenter avant la fin de l annee une modification de la directive cee et que cette directive soit applicable toute travailleuse enceinte dans tous les domaines et dans tous les emplois sans exception ni condition
french la nouvelle reglementation doit tre claire et progressiste
french elle doit envisager les nouvelles situations professionnelles et la nouvelle situation familiale des familles monoparentales
french la travailleuse enceinte doit pouvoir disposer d une protection adequate specifique son etat mais cela ne doit pas aboutir une discrimination son egard ni reduire ses chances d acceder un emploi bien au contraire
french il faut tre capable de trouver les moyens adequats pour que l allaitement soit compatible avec le travail
french oui monsieur le president aujourd hui en europe le divorce entre femme et emploi est inconcevable le divorce entre femme et maternite encore moins
french monsieur le president le rapport de la commission que j ai lu tr s attentivement stipule qu en termes generaux la directive cee a correctement ete mise en x uvre par les etats membres et que cette mise en x uvre est refletee par le nombre peu eleve de plaintes re ues par la commission relatives aux droits de travailleuses enceintes
french le rapporteur a ecarte cette declaration affirmant en fait qu elle n est pas pertinente et que la directive n est pas allee assez loin
french j apprecie certaines suggestions contenues dans son rapport
french je la felicite pour l enthousiasme avec lequel elle a poursuivi son programme
french toutefois en general ce n est pas un programme ayant trait la sante et la securite
french c est un programme qui s inscrit tout fait dans la tradition socialiste
french premi rement son rapport a pour but d harmoniser la politique sociale au sein de l ue au lieu d en laisser les details aux etats membres point qu a souligne avec force m olle schmidt plus t t lors de ce debat
french deuxi mement il vise ameliorer les termes et conditions d emploi pour les travailleuses enceintes et les nouvelles m res par le biais de conges de maternite supplementaires et de niveaux de salaires minimum specifies
french aucune de ces deux mesures ne constitue de veritables questions de sante ou de securite
french elle propose des solutions pour lesquelles il n existe ni de probl me de sante ni de probl me de securite
french en tant que conservateurs britanniques nous confirmons que nous nous preoccupons de la sante et de la securite de tous les travailleurs en particulier des groupes vulnerables
french nous confirmons notre engagement la subsidiarite en ce qui concerne les termes et les conditions d emploi
french toutefois nous confirmons egalement que nous nous soucions egalement d aider davantage de femmes acquerir un emploi plut t que de dresser des barri res au detriment des emplois feminins
french d s lors nous invitons instamment l assemblee rejeter ce rapport
french monsieur le president ce texte est important dans la mesure o la legislation concernee a des consequences non negligeables pour le bien tre des femmes et aussi des enfants c est dire l avenir de notre societe
french cet egard nous pouvons nous etonner que la commission ait attendu aussi longtemps pour nous presenter son rapport d evaluation sur la mise en x uvre de cette directive et des propositions d amelioration des conditions d exercice du conge de maternite
french il me semble que dans cette proposition de revision de la directive que nous demandons la commission de presenter rapidement il est essentiel de preserver la realite de trois principes fondamentaux pour la femme et son epanouissement l interdiction du licenciement de la femme enceinte ou en conge de maternite le droit un conge minimum obligatoire et la remuneration de ce conge comptabilisee dans les droits la pension
french il me semble par ailleurs que cette nouvelle directive devrait comporter des ameliorations substantielles notamment la possibilite offerte toute femme de beneficier d un conge de maternite porte vingt semaines sans obligation pour celle ci de le prendre dans son integralite mais avec obligation pour l employeur de le proposer et avec une obligation minimale de huit semaines apr s l accouchement afin de favoriser le developpement du lien m re enfant
french en ce qui concerne les grossesses risque et l arrivee au foyer d enfants handicapes il est evident qu il faudra prevoir des propositions adaptees offrant compte tenu des specificites une extension de la duree du conge de maternite
french en ce qui concerne la definition de la prestation il appara t que le chiffre prendre en consideration doit tre d au moins du salaire precedent y compris dans la constitution des droits la pension
french enfin il est souhaitable que ce texte renforce correlativement l interdiction formelle du licenciement pendant la grossesse et le conge de maternite
french monsieur le president je voudrais feliciter le rapporteur pour son travail de sauvegarde des inter ts des femmes un moment particulier de leur vie savoir la grossesse et la maternite
french il represente un grand pas en avant non seulement en faveur des femmes en general mais il assure surtout le droit fonder une famille et en defend les valeurs fondamentales
french le parti populaire europeen a toujours estime que le concept de la famille en tant que noyau fondamental de la societe constitue la base de la construction europeenne et que les valeurs chretiennes dont il s inspire en imposent le respect
french une epoque o l europe est en butte des probl mes demographiques il faut que les institutions donnent un signal fort capable de rassurer les femmes qui travaillent et qui doivent jouir de la serenite et des garanties necessaires pour les decider devenir m res
french voil pourquoi elles doivent beneficier d une periode de repos adaptee avant l accouchement et encore plus apr s quand elles ont un enfant allaiter aider grandir et elever
french les femmes qui viennent d accoucher ne doivent donc pas tre soumises une baisse de revenus particuli re et surtout leurs droits la retraite ne peuvent tre affectes
french j ajouterai qu en l occurrence il faut egalement garantir aux travailleuses independantes un droit aux indemnites de maternite qui doivent tre couvertes par des fonds nationaux sectoriels base contributive
french enfin je voudrais exprimer mon soutien l interdiction de licenciement au cours de cette periode et l idee que les co ts decoulant des indemnites accordees une travailleuse accouchee ne gr vent pas directement le budget de l entreprise privee qui l emploie mais soient supportes integralement par l institution publique et ce afin d eviter les discriminations sur le marche de l emploi
french mesdames et messieurs les deputes je vous demande un peu de silence non pas religieux mais parlementaire afin que nous puissions ecouter avec attention la commissaire de palacio
french monsieur le president je voudrais d emblee feliciter mme dami o pour le magnifique rapport qu elle a elabore bien qu il contienne une serie de critiques quant l action de la commission
french critiques que je dois accepter car elles sont justifiees et fondees sur des faits reels
french mais je dois donner une justification et une explication
french pour rediger ce texte la commission a d compter sur les documents fournis par les differents etats et malheureusement ces documents n ont pas ete fournis avec la celerite et l efficacite souhaitee par la commission
french c est ce qui explique le retard dans la presentation
french evidemment la commission partage pleinement l inter t du parlement pour l amelioration de la protection des travailleuses enceintes et de celles qui viennent d accoucher
french la legislation communautaire et la jurisprudence de la cour de justice des communautes europeennes n offrent pas encore un cadre suffisant mais il s agit indubitablement d elements cles pour progresser dans ce domaine essentiel qu est la garantie des droits des travailleuses enceintes
french la directive a ete adoptee avant le traite d amsterdam
french nous pensons que c est precisement maintenant apr s le traite que nous pouvons aller encore au del et progresser
french tel est notre objectif et c est pourquoi nous allons preparer un rapport complementaire sur la mise en pratique de cette directive rapport que nous presenterons en
french comme vous le savez tr s bien la commission a approuve la semaine derni re son nouvel agenda social pour la periode et c est dans ce cadre que nous esperons proposer une solution adequate ce probl me concret et toute une serie d autres questions
french monsieur le president c est la derni re fois cette semaine que nous serons aussi nombreux dans cette salle
french j aimerais attirer votre attention et celle de mes coll gues sur un point tr s regrettable
french ce parlement jouit d une excellente reputation aupr s de la presse car depuis vingt ans dej le parlement parvenait publier deux fois par jour tous les jours un communique l attention de la presse ecrite
french ce syst me a fait l objet de modifications
french j ai observe le fonctionnement de ce syst me pendant la semaine qui vient de s ecouler
french le communique de presse relatif la memoire de l ancien president m pflimlin n a ete publie qu h lundi soir le rapport sur le sommet de feira a ete dep che mardi matin
french le compte rendu sur la seance consacree l octroi de la decharge de mardi matin a ete envoye mardi soir h le rapport sur le zimbabwe du mardi apr s midi a ete communique le soir h
french le rapport sur la banque centrale europeenne de mercredi matin a ete envoye h le m me jour
french par consequent la presse ecrite se trouve dans l incapacite de se prononcer sur ces evenements en effet ces heures tardives les redactions sont dej fermees et nous fournissons des nouvelles desu tes
french je voudrais vous inviter monsieur le president revenir l ancien syst me et veiller ce que les communiques de presse quotidiens paraissent non seulement temps mais qu ils donnent egalement un aper u complet et decentralise par langue
french je souhaiterais donc que vous priiez le bureau d y reflechir serieusement et de revenir sur une decision prise anterieurement
french monsieur le president je suis desole de retarder le parlement pour une motion de procedure alors que je ne suis pas sans savoir que nous devons encore proceder nombreux votes
french je viens juste de decouvrir dans l agenda que le vote sur mon propre rapport doit tre effectue en dernier lieu
french je n ai pas ete consulte ce propos
french en effet j avais signale auparavant qu il devait avoir lieu le plus t t possible lors de l heure des votes dans la mesure o et etant l un de ceux concernes par l aviation je le sais mieux que la plupart d entre vous je ne dispose que d un vol pour rentrer chez moi
french je suis donc bloque
french je m en remets donc la merci du parlement et lui demande s il serait possible de proceder au vote sur le rapport atkins plus t t au lieu de le retarder
french je prends acte de votre demande
french monsieur le president si vous deviez donner suite la demande de mon coll gue je propose alors d etablir l ordre de classement des votes comme il a ete conclu hier
french il en irait alors tout autrement
french monsieur mombaur je n ai pas accepte la demande de m atkins j en ai seulement pris acte
french l ordre des votes est etabli et je n y derogerai pas je suis desole mais le vote sur certains rapports aura lieu cet apr s midi et non ce matin
french nous passons maintenant l heure des votes
french votes
french monsieur le president vous l avez dej declare le vote s effectue sur la base de propositions de compromis qui ont ete degagees lors d une concertation informelle avec la commission
french nous avons renvoye le rapport le mai et entre temps nous avons pu y apporter certaines ameliorations
french par une telle procedure le parlement a reaffirme la commission sa volonte d atteindre une codecision totale en commission de l agriculture et dans le domaine de l agriculture
french c est ce que nous a permis d atteindre ce type de procedure
french je voudrais remercier la commission pour sa collaboration dans ce domaine et j esp re que les compromis degages seront egalement soutenus par la commission au conseil et qu ils ne pourront tre rejetes qu l unanimite
french nous avons de ce fait atteint la commission et le parlement reunis une position forte et j esp re que cela servira egalement d exemple lors de la conference intergouvernementale de nice
french monsieur le president chers membres de la commission chers coll gues je voudrais remercier sinc rement non seulement la commission mais egalement tous les collaborateurs et les coll gues de la commission de l agriculture pour le compromis atteint
french je vous demande d approuver ce dossier sans quoi le conseil du et juillet serait en mesure de prendre une decision sans l avis du parlement etant donne que selon un arr t de la cour de justice des communautes europeennes nous n aurions pas donne suite une collaboration loyale
french c est pourquoi je vous demande de voter ce dossier aujourd hui
french encore merci pour cette cooperation
french madame la commissaire voulez vous repondre aux questions de m maat
french monsieur le president mesdames et messieurs je voudrais faire quelques br ves remarques
french je confirme l approbation de la commission en ce qui concerne douze des treize amendements de compromis
french la commission emet juste quelques reserves quant aux termes juridiques utilises et l agencement des amendements de compromis dans le texte
french mais sur le fond ceux ci seront soutenus par la commission lors de la discussion avec le conseil
french en ce qui concerne la proposition d amendement je voudrais faire observer que le transfert volontaire de quotes parts entre etats membres ne peut tre utilise qu une seule fois sans quoi cela pourrait engendrer des probl mes fussent ils mineurs au niveau du syst me de distribution
french en ce qui concerne la proposition d amendement la commission prend acte des inquietudes de la commission par rapport au niveau d aide pour les fibres longues mais doit tout simplement faire remarquer une nouvelle fois qu il existe bien entendu des possibilites limitees d evaluation si un rapport ce sujet doit dej tre redige apr s la premi re annee de mise en x uvre de la reforme
french au nom de mon coll gue fischler et de la commission je peux encore remercier le parlement pour cette cooperation et je pense que les propositions de compromis qui ont ete elaborees ont contribue une amelioration et surtout une evolution de la situation

french monsieur le president chers coll gues je regrette de devoir m exprimer en ce lieu sur le rapport kuhne mais il s agit d une affaire grave
french comme chacun sait on trouve dans ce rapport qui traite de la decharge du budget du parlement pour l annee un chiffre et un alinea
french cet alinea parle de notre groupe politique
french il existait un accord entre les presidents de groupe ceux ci le confirmeront d apr s lequel nous ne traiterions pas des cas concrets dans ce rapport mais que nous nous efforcerions ensemble l o subsistent certains probl mes d y remedier
french au vu de la formulation de ce rapport j ai cependant depose une proposition de compromis au nom de mon groupe politique et on m a signale il y a quelques jours que ce compromis rencontrerait l approbation du rapporteur
french sur ce nous avons renonce deposer un amendement qui traiterait egalement des probl mes du groupe socialiste
french j entends present que le groupe socialiste ne soutiendra vraisemblablement pas l amendement qui porte mon nom
french je declare ici avec gravite et regret que l accord des presidents de groupe n a pas ete respecte qu on a fait fi de l equite
french je declare egalement que mon groupe se sent dupe pas moi personnellement mais bel et bien l ensemble de mon groupe
french si le groupe socialiste n approuve pas la proposition d amendement c est son probl me je signale que ce groupe prendra aujourd hui une decision tr s grave
french applaudissements du groupe ppe de
french monsieur poettering comme vous le savez les explications de vote se donnent apr s l heure des votes
french nous ne pouvons pas lancer un debat maintenant m me si le sujet est fort delicat
french oui monsieur le president je constate que la loi n est pas la m me pour tous car j ai voulu faire une intervention dans le m me sens lors de la seance pleni re precedente sur la resolution sur feira et l on ne m y pas autorise si bien que j ai d la faire la fin je me souviens que les protestations etaient generalisees sur ces bancs pour que l on respecte le r glement
french aujourd hui il n en a pas ete de m me
french ce que je voudrais signaler au nom de mon groupe c est qu il est absolument inadmissible premi rement que l on cite un accord inexistant et deuxi mement que l on menace mon groupe
french il est insense de conditionner le vote des autres
french j accepte que l on defende ses positions mais il est inacceptable qu cette occasion avant le vote on menace mon groupe au sujet d une question qui a ete votee par la commission du contr le budgetaire avec les votes aussi des deputes de ses bancs
french par ailleurs pour conclure monsieur le president je preciserai qu aucun groupe n est mentionne dans le rapport kuhne
french je recommande m poettering de lire attentivement le rapport
french applaudissements du groupe pse

french des discussions relatives la definition des categories ont dej eu lieu en comite de gestion et la commission l espoir que des solutions qui satisferont la majorite si pas la totalite des etats membres seront trouvees
french la commission est d s lors d avis que l introduction des r gles d identification le er septembre prochain est importante
french en relan ant le debat leur entree en vigueur pourrait tre retardee
french c est la raison pour laquelle les propositions d amendement ne peuvent tre acceptees
french en ce qui concerne la proposition d amendement la commission est arrivee la conclusion que la proposition de r glement exige dej la garantie compl te de l origine
french c est la raison pour laquelle la commission ne voit aucune raison d accepter cette proposition d amendement et exprime egalement sa desapprobation l egard de la proposition d amendement
french je fais toutefois observer au nom de la commission qu il est possible d s present d indiquer la date de production de la viande hachee selon la procedure volontaire simplifiee
french je tiens egalement faire remarquer que m fischer a declare hier que suite aux discussions qui se sont tenues au sein du parlement lors de la premi re lecture une grande majorite des amendements ont ete acceptes et figurent dej dans le texte

french il n est bien evidemment pas agreable de devoir brutalement retirer un engagement pris dans le cadre du travail parlementaire
french en ce qui concerne l immigration clandestine et la question des passeurs les membres de mon groupe politique n ont pas tous la m me opinion

french e president vu l heure nous interrompons ici l heure des votes qui reprendra h
french monsieur le president je respecte votre decision
french je pense toutefois que voter une legislation le jeudi apr s midi de la periode de juillet et le prochain rapport est un rapport legislatif est plus que leger je m y oppose donc energiquement
french madame roth behrendt je voudrais vous informer qu il n y a pas qu un rapport caract re legislatif mais bien quatre
french d s lors si nous souhaitons les traiter tous de la m me fa on nous devrions continuer voter bien au del de heures ce que nous ne pouvons pas faire
french ensuite on vote normalement quand l assemblee est disposee le faire et non dans une situation d indisponibilite
french l heure des votes est interrompue
french explications de vote
french monsieur le president en vue du vote sur le rapport papayannakis je voudrais demander la commission de convenir d un comite de conciliation pour la semaine prochaine de mani re ce que nous puissions tirer ce probl me au clair avant l echeance du er septembre
french pourriez vous transmettre cela au commissaire car elle n ecoute pas en ce moment
french rapport schierhuber a
french el il y a de serieuses reserves formuler quant la proposition de r glement ce relative au lin et au chanvre destines la production de fibres et cela parce que les contingents entre pays membres sont inegalement repartis
french les pays ayant un vaste secteur agricole et un taux eleve d emploi dans des metiers agricoles comme la gr ce disposent des contingents les plus bas pour le lin comme pour le chanvre
french cette occasion nous devons souligner la necessite de mener une campagne d information dans les pays membres afin de pallier l ignorance et la demagogie dont le chanvre textile est victime au point que dans des cas comme la gr ce la police a procede la fermeture de magasins qui vendaient des tissus de chanvre et que de petites entreprises ont ete ruinees
french rapport stauner a
french monsieur le president les retraites comme les personnes gees sont favorables aux nouveautes m me si d aucuns pourraient penser le contraire c est pourquoi chaque fois que l on adopte de nouvelles r gles pour les fonds structurels afin de lancer des actions novatrices le representant du parti des retraites que je suis ne peut que se rejouir
french cette occasion et je le fais volontiers j esp re apr s avoir evidemment explique mon vote favorable qu l avenir on introduira egalement parmi les projets financer en tant qu actions innovatrices des projets visant non seulement l amelioration du travail au sens strict mais aussi tout ce qui concerne les pensionnes qui profitent desormais des contributions qu ils ont versees tout au long de leur vie professionnelle la retraite constitue dans un sens large un prolongement de la carri re
french rapport virrankoski a
french monsieur le president j interviens simplement pour dire que les deputes radicaux se sont abstenus lors du vote sur le rapport virrankoski parce que le conseil a voulu s accaparer a voulu integrer dans son budget les depenses decoulant des missions que des experts militaires ou autres pourraient tre conduits effectuer dans le cadre de la pesc
french puisque notre parlement a toujours veille de pr s ce que les depenses relatives la pesc fassent partie integrante du budget de l union et figurent donc au budget de la commission nous nous inquietons de la derive que peut susciter le rapport virrankoski c est dire de la tendance inclure de plus en plus dans le budget du conseil des frais de fonctionnement des depenses operationnelles en ce qui concerne la pesc
french c est pour cette raison que nous nous sommes abstenus lors du vote sur le rapport virrankoski
french nous avons vote contre l octroi d une somme d argent supplementaire aux conseillers militaires parce que nous estimons qu une politique de paix a besoin d experts en mati re de paix et d une resolution non violente des conflits
french rapport stauner a
french monsieur le president le parlement ne peut mon sens se satisfaire des resultats atteints jusqu present
french cette decharge de la commission nous fait courir le risque de perdre toute credibilite dans le domaine du contr le budgetaire et de la lutte contre la fraude
french j ignore egalement si tous les membres de l assemblee ont conscience qu en approuvant la decharge nous devons egalement assumer la responsabilite des dommages
french il sera difficile d expliquer aux citoyens europeens que dans l affaire flechard millions d euros de recettes fiscales ont ete jetes par la fen tre et que le parlement se paye de fausses promesses
french tous les membres de l assemblee qui ont vote pour la decharge de la commission en assument par consequent la responsabilite personnelle
french ne nous etonnons d s lors pas si le citoyen perd de plus en plus confiance en l europe
french au nom de mon groupe je voudrais d s lors signaler que c est pour cette raison que nous avons vote contre la decharge de la commission
french les membres du groupe uen ont vote ce juillet contre l octroi de la decharge pour l execution du budget general de l union europeenne pour l exercice
french nous avons pris cette decision parce que l actuelle commission qui s etait engagee effectuer une vaste reforme de son administration ne temoigne pas d une volonte suffisante pour mener bien cette reforme
french les nombreux exemples d absence de volonte d atermoiements et de refus de livrer des documents la commission du contr le budgetaire ainsi que le fait incroyable que des rapports et des proc s verbaux capitaux disparaissent des archives o ils devraient se trouver temoignent f cheusement d une volonte de poursuivre une administration qui est synonyme de pouvoir absolu
french il est evident que l absence de transparence a pour but de proteger les membres et les fonctionnaires de la commission contre les sanctions utilisees dans toute administration democratique nationale et sans lesquelles l union europeenne ne fonctionnera jamais
french j ai cite l occasion du debat des affaires qui n ont toujours pas ete reglees mais il ne s agit l que des sympt mes individuels d une maladie
french un an apr s son entree en fonction la commission n a toujours pas presente la moindre proposition visant modifier radicalement les dispositions relatives aux statuts des fonctionnaires les statuts actuels leur offrent une protection legale contre l incompetence et la malhonn tete ce qui est totalement absurde pour une administration qui se dit democratique
french l examen du present rapport au sein de la commission du contr le budgetaire a en outre montre que certains deputes sont plus enclins proteger la commission contre les contribuables europeens qu veiller ce que l argent de ces m mes contribuables soit administree de fa on honn te et efficace
french des pressions intolerables sont exercees l encontre de plusieurs rapporteurs et les milieux vereux qui ont inter t emp cher que les cas de fraude et d escroquerie les plus graves commis dans l administration de la commission ne soient elucides n hesitent pas recourir des menaces physiques
french une majorite de deputes a decide ce jour d octroyer la decharge
french je ne pense pas que beaucoup d entre eux soient satisfaits de l administration financi re de la commission mais nous sommes arrives un point o la majorite des deputes pref re fermer les yeux plut t que risquer que leurs citoyens et electeurs ne se rendent compte de l ampleur des scandales qui ont lieu annee apr s annee
french je suis convaincu que la majorite des membres regretteront la longue leur complaisance
french en tant que rapporteur de la commission du contr le budgetaire j ai recommande le juin dernier la decharge la commission pour l annee
french aujourd hui j ai vote contre cette decharge
french l element determinant a ete le comportement de la commissaire au budget par rapport l affaire flechard
french cette firme est soup onnee de fraude depuis
french on lui a toutefois fait gr ce d une caution d un montant de millions d euros
french cela n a pas emp che la commission de continuer faire des affaires avec elle sans se poser la moindre question
french present la police financi re italienne m ne une enqu te et on dit que la firme serait m lee des transactions illicites et des falsifications de grande ampleur dans le secteur du beurre
french bien entendu cela ne peut donner lieu des jugements prematures
french la commissaire au budget n a cependant pas le droit de refuser de reveler combien de millions la commission a paye cette firme au cours des annees ecoulees
french le mai dernier mme schreyer avait promis de faire part de ces chiffres la commission du contr le budgetaire mais ne les a toujours pas presentes
french elle a constamment utilise de nouvelles excuses
french mardi dernier elle a voulu nous faire croire de mani re mensong re que le r glement interdirait la communication des chiffres
french le budget de la communaute n est pas un secret d etat
french si la commission refuse de nous en rendre compte nous ne pouvons y repondre que par un refus de decharge
french mme redondo a demande la parole pour une question de procedure
french monsieur le president je voudrais vous demander que le vote sur le rapport relatif la protection des for ts soit reporte la prochaine seance car aujourd hui pour des raisons independantes de ma volonte je dois quitter ce parlement heures
french madame redondo par manque de temps nous n avons pas pu mettre aux voix certains rapports caract re legislatif nous le ferons d s lors cet apr s midi apr s le debat d actualite comme de coutume
french monsieur le president en ce qui concerne l ordre des votes je me permets de vous demander de veiller l avenir ce que les actes legislatifs soient votes en premier lieu car la t che principale du parlement consiste legiferer
french je ne suis pas d accord avec le fait que nous nous soyons dej interrompus apr s une heure et demie de travaux mais je dois bien l accepter
french cependant je ne suis absolument pas d accord avec le fait que nous constituions un ordre des votes aux termes duquel les textes legislatifs ne sont automatiquement votes que le jeudi soir
french je demande donc de modifier l ordre des votes en consequence
french comme vous le savez certaines decisions sont prises par la conference des presidents
french normalement quand nous commen ons voter midi nous le faisons pendant une heure
french aujourd hui nous avons commence voter h et termine vers h le temps disponible pour voter sur certaines resolutions comme celles sur le conseil europeen de feira sur le zimbabwe et sur la traite des tres humains etait relativement court
french le vote sur les projets legislatifs demande quant lui beaucoup de temps
french quoi qu il en soit ce n est pas le moment d en discuter
french nous tiendrons compte de votre remarque et la transmettrons la conference des presidents parce que dans l ordre des votes tel que nous l avons adopte tous les examens en deuxi me lecture un element qui concerne notre capacite en tant qu assemblee legislative passent selon l ordre des projets relatifs notre pouvoir de colegislation
french monsieur le president pardonnez moi de reprendre l o je m etais arr tee et de revenir sur ce que m swoboda vient de dire
french monsieur le president je comprends tout ce que vous avez dit mais cette semaine pour la premi re fois nous n avons eu aucun vote le mardi midi
french c est la decision qui a ete prise
french nous y etions opposes la majorite de l assemble si elle l avait su les rapporteurs mme redondo jimenez ou m arvidsson et les autres s y seraient egalement opposes
french mais si nous faisons cela cette demarche exige egalement de notre part un certain degre de flexibilite
french dans cette assemblee plus reduite je n hesite pas dire que la plupart d entre nous sont des parlementaires experimentes et nous savons qu il y a des seances differentes
french la seance de juillet du jeudi est une seance d une sensibilite particuli re
french nous le savons tous ce n est peut tre pas bien mais c est ainsi
french c est pourquoi je vous demande de verifier si les quatre rapports legislatifs qui figurent encore l ordre du jour et qui ne necessitent plus de longues periodes de vote ne peuvent pas tre reportes la prochaine seance
french c est ce qu a demande mme redondo jimenez en ce qui concerne son rapport et elle a mon soutien
french m arvidsson tout cela concerne les domaines que je connais sera lui aussi je l esp re d accord avec cette requ te et je vous demande d s lors de prendre contact avec les rapporteurs et les groupes politiques
french m swoboda l a dej dit et je peux le repeter pour mon groupe politique si les quatre rapports legislatifs doivent tre reportes au mois de septembre ou une seance bruxelles nous serons d accord
french madame roth behrendt vous savez que le report se demande soit au debut de la seance le matin soit au debut du vote
french donc cet apr s midi quand nous commencerons les votes un rapporteur ou un coll gue demandera le report au mois de septembre
french je n ai aucune objection formuler sur cette requ te
french monsieur le president vous avez enti rement raison c est en effet la procedure correcte
french mais si nous prevoyons cela et qu il est certain que par ma faute m swoboda moi ou d autres vont protester il serait juste d informer les rapporteurs de cette possibilite
french quoi qu il en soit le president de seance sera informe de cette requ te et donnera evidemment la parole un depute qui exposera alors cette demande
french rapport ruhle a
french monsieur le president j ai vote contre le rapport ruhle
french je pense tout d abord qu il y a une erreur dans les chiffres parce qu on parle d un budget pour de quelque milliards d euros du moins dans la version italienne ce qui me semble premi re vue un peu trop
french je crois qu il y a une erreur d au moins trois zeros
french cette parenth se etant fermee je voudrais souligner que parmi les autres points inacceptables comme le rapporteur l a dej dit dans son rapport raison pour laquelle il aurait ete logique qu il termine par une demande de vote contraire son document il serait bon que l on accorde l avenir au moins une partie de ces fonds aux associations de volontaires dont de nombreux retraites disposes parcourir le monde pour aider au developpement des pays qui en ont le besoin
french fort juste titre lors de sa seance du avril le parlement europeen decidait de reporter la decision donnant decharge la commission europeenne sur l execution du budget de l exercice
french cette decision etait legitime dans la mesure o les citoyens de nos nations sont en droit de demander des comptes sur la mani re dont est depense l argent de l union europeenne leur argent
french notre groupe determine est pleinement favorable tout ce qui peut tre entrepris afin de lutter avec energie contre la fraude et les malversations
french en effet les irregularites constatees tant celles abordees dans le rapport de mme stauner propos de la gestion contestable de la commission que celles mises en exergue dans le rapport de mme ruhle sur les differents fonds europeens de developpement ne peuvent laisser indifferent et portent atteinte l image et la credibilite de la communaute dans son ensemble
french aussi mes chers coll gues devons nous en tirer toutes les consequences en termes de sanction des responsables certes mais aussi de mise en x uvre de procedures beaucoup plus transparentes
french tels qu ils ressortent des votes intervenus en commission du contr le budgetaire les rapports de mmes ruhle et stauner vont nous semble t il dans ce sens
french le rapport de mme ruhle sur les differents fed met desormais clairement la commission en face de ses responsabilites il exige plus de clarte pour l ensemble des aides venir distribuees par la communaute au profit des pays en voie de developpement
french le souci d une plus grande moralisation de la politique des aides et de l efficacite de leur utilisation est un principe desormais clairement pose et notre groupe s en felicite
french il ne saurait tre question cependant d accepter que sous pretexte d un meilleur contr le afin d aboutir une utilisation plus honn te et plus rationnelle des fonds europeens et je pense en particulier aux pays d afrique des cara bes et du pacifique que notre demarche soit pretexte organiser par ailleurs le proc s infonde de certain pays de l union au demeurant l un des principaux contributeurs nets je veux parler de la france par le biais d une chasse aux sorci res qui viserait dit on certains hauts fonctionnaires d une m me nationalite
french une plus grande transparence c est aussi notre souci premier en ce qui concerne les finances des groupes politiques au sein de notre assemblee les citoyens de l europe ne comprendraient d ailleurs pas que nous tenions un autre discours
french aussi devons nous prendre acte des reponses fournies par notre institution suite aux observations de la cour des comptes et encourager sans tarder toute reforme pertinente conformement au r glement financier et au principe de transparence
french pour conclure je dirai ceci est clair nos yeux qu il convient de ne pas introduire de confusion entre la procedure de decharge laquelle represente une appreciation globale sur la gestion de la commission europeenne telle que prevue par le traite et le traitement de plusieurs affaires ponctuelles qui d une evidente gravite presentent aussi un caract re ponctuel et un montant faible au regard du total du budget
french il faut savoir raison garder
french tout autant prendre acte des precisions supplementaires que nous avions demandees la commission au printemps dans le cadre du rapport stauner ne signifie nullement pour notre groupe que notre institution soit ensuite frappee d amnesie dans la traque de pratiques inacceptables au detriment des deniers de nos concitoyens
french notre groupe salue les efforts louables realises par les rapporteurs mmes stauner et ruhle et m kuhne cependant il convient de rester attentif et de pouvoir observer l experience quelle sera l attitude de la commission europeenne au vu des engagements qu elle a pris
french aussi notre groupe estime t il necessaire pour l heure de s abstenir
french rapport kuhne a
french j ai vote contre la decharge du secretaire general car en ce qui concerne l achat du b timent asp bruxelles il a communique aux organes decisionnels des informations erronees
french on a par erreur laisse croire que le conseil et la commission auraient approuve un financement du b timent avec l aide de l ancien promoteur immobilier
french on a en outre laisse croire que le financement du b timent avec l aide du promoteur immobilier etait une forme indirecte de financement
french en le parlement s est en fait endette de millions d ecus et de milliards de francs belges vis vis d un consortium bancaire dirige par la westlb sans qu il n y ait un appel d offres prealable au journal officiel
french d apr s les constatations de la cour des comptes les r glements financiers y afferents ont en outre ete violes
french rapport papayannakis a
french il aura fallu conna tre le scandale de la vache folle pour que l on prenne conscience de la necessite d ameliorer la tra abilite et l etiquetage des produits alimentaires
french l europe a beaucoup tarde reagir et a pris un retard considerable en mati re de viande bovine
french aujourd hui sur la base d un accord unanime au sein du conseil nous avons l occasion de montrer enfin un peu de determination
french en effet la position commune qui nous est soumise reprend un grand nombre des amendements que notre parlement a adoptes en premi re lecture
french concernant les mentions obligatoires l indication de l origine les dates de mise en x uvre la viande hachee et le syst me facultatif je crois que le parlement peut tre satisfait le conseil nous a entendus
french c est pourquoi j ai soutenu avec determination cette position commune en l etat et n ai vote aucun amendement
french le debat s est focalise sur quelques points specifiques et notamment sur l indication sur l etiquette de la categorie de l animal
french certains coll gues nous ont explique en toute bonne foi que cette mention ne participe en rien l amelioration de la tra abilite de la viande bovine
french ils ont raison
french mais apr s la succession des scandales alimentaires que notre parlement a toujours denonces avec vigueur comment pourrions nous aujourd hui ne pas tenir compte du r le immense que joue le consommateur
french la mention expresse de la categorie repond une demande
french elle contribue restaurer la confiance des consommateurs
french il faut distinguer deux types d information
french l information permettant d ameliorer la tra abilite mais qui n est pas directement destinee informer le consommateur final
french trop specifique elle n est formellement lisible que par les professionnels
french elle remplit une fonction sanitaire
french c est sur la base de ces mentions que les contr les pourront tre effectues
french nous parlons alors de la mise en place du syst me d identification et de la tra abilite
french le deuxi me type d information est destine directement au citoyen comme vous et moi qui ach te sa viande tous les jours
french que veut il savoir
french il veut tre certain que le produit qu il va consommer est sain le syst me de tra abilite et d identification permettra de garantir la securite et la qualite de la viande bovine
french mais le citoyen souhaite egalement savoir de quel type de viande il s agit
french ce type de mention sur l etiquette s adresse directement au consommateur final et lui donne une information intelligible
french c est une erreur que de dire que cela ne sert rien
french au contraire cet etiquetage est aussi important que la mise en place de garanties sanitaires
french l europe doit redonner confiance ses consommateurs qui boudent la viande bovine depuis le scandale de la vache folle
french les consequences sont importantes pour l ensemble de ce secteur agro alimentaire qui a ete touche de plein fouet par cette crise
french ces deux types d information ne sont pas concurrents ils sont complementaires et contribuent chacun son niveau restaurer la confiance des consommateurs europeens
french la confiance de nos consommateurs ne se decr te pas elle se gagne
french rapport garcia orcoyen tormo a
french en le fait pour l union europeenne de s assurer que les entreprises traitent leurs affaires dans le respect de l environnement est un objectif politique juste
french le syst me communautaire de management environnemental et d audit connu sous le nom d emas a donne aux entreprises de l ue l occasion d obtenir l agrement qu elles mettent en x uvre de bonnes pratiques environnementales dans le cadre de leurs activites
french il est aujourd hui question de la revision du r glement original de qui a instaure le syst me communautaire de management environnemental et d audit
french les crit res d admission dans le registre emas sont tr s stricts
french le fait est que les resultats obtenus par les autorites nationales de normalisation de chaque etat membre de l union europeenne sont transmis au public
french chaque autorite nationale de normalisation proc de une analyse detaillee et compl te de toutes les activites d un candidat eventuel au syst me emas pouvant affecter l environnement
french dans le nouveau r glement dont il est question aujourd hui il sera plus facile pour les petites et moyennes entreprises de demander l agrement dans le cadre du syst me emas
french dans l ensemble seules les compagnies industrielles de grande taille ont cherche jusqu present la reconnaissance dans le cadre du syst me communautaire de management environnemental et d audit
french nous devons nous rappeler que le syst me emas est la version europeenne de la norme iso connue sous le nom d iso
french la norme iso est par essence l equivalent de l iso pour les compagnies europeennes assortie toutefois de la perspective environnementale appropriee
french la politique correcte de l union europeenne est d assurer que toutes les entreprises europeennes respectent l environnement et veillent mettre en place les pratiques necessaires pour garantir que leurs activites n ont pas un impact negatif sur l environnement sous quelque forme que ce soit
french quelle que soit la severite des r glements il doit y avoir une plus grande flexibilite dans le syst me afin de garantir que tous les secteurs et toutes les entreprises de l union europeenne ait une chance d obtenir l agrement dans le cadre du syst me communautaire de management environnemental et d audit
french je soutiens totalement ce programme et recommande ce rapport
french recommandation pour la deuxi me lecture breyer a
french monsieur le president j ai vote en faveur de cette recommandation qui etablit des valeurs limites pour le benz ne et le monoxyde de carbone dans l air ambiant
french j y suis bien evidemment favorable parce que les personnes gees et les retraites figurent parmi les premiers touches leurs poumons etant souvent un peu mal en point
french part cela je voudrais insister sur ma demande qu l avenir on ne se preoccupe pas seulement de l air que respirent nos concitoyens mais aussi de celui que respirent les travailleurs en contact par exemple avec le benz ne et le monoxyde de carbone
french il serait bon que nous faisions en sorte que leurs horaires soient reduits par rapport ceux des autres travailleurs de sorte qu ils puissent profiter de la vie moyenne des autres citoyens
french je crois que l union europeenne devrait se pencher en particulier sur les conditions de travail des citoyens qui respirent les substances nocives que nous tentons justement d epargner aux pietons
french la protection des travailleurs doit tre meilleure encore
french recommandation pour la deuxi me lecture jackson a
french monsieur le president j ai vote favorablement et felicite le rapporteur mme jackson qui a tant insiste pour que l on transforme en directive cette recommandation sur l organisation concr te d inspections environnementales
french il est vain que ce parlement adopte des centaines et des milliers de directives et de r glements importants et utiles si l on ne m ne pas les contr les effectifs concrets et suffisants pour que ces reglementations soient reellement appliquees et que les citoyens europeens en tirent un benefice reel notamment comme je viens de le dire quand il est question de sante environnementale comme dans ce cas et quand le non respect des r gles porte prejudice surtout aux personnes gees et aux retraites
french en le principal objectif de cette recommandation est de renforcer le respect et de contribuer une mise en x uvre et une application plus coherente de la legislation communautaire en mati re d environnement dans les etats membres
french ce projet de recommandation fixe les crit res minimaux appliquer l organisation l execution le suivi et la publication des resultats des inspections environnementales
french il prevoit des inspections environnementales de toutes les entreprises industrielles et autres dont les emissions et les decharges dans l environnement sont soumises des autorisations speciales ou l obtention de licences
french c est sans aucun doute le cas de toutes les compagnies qui re oivent des licences en mati re de contr le de la pollution sous les auspices des agences pour la protection de l environnement
french si l on en croit le texte de cette recommandation les inspections environnementales incluront visites de sites verification des operations de contr le interne realisees par les exploitants des installations contr lees contr le des infrastructures de l equipement et de la gestion adequate de l environnement sur le terrain ainsi que des documents conserves par les exploitants
french deux types d inspections sont envisagees les inspections reguli res qui constituent une partie d un programme d inspection planifie et inspections ponctuelles afin d assurer le suivi des plaintes liees l octroi et au renouvellement ou la modification de differentes licences
french les etats membres devront prealablement elaborer des plans pour les activites d inspection environnementale couvrant l ensemble de leur territoire respectif et les installations situees sur celui ci
french ces plans seront mis la disposition du public au travers des campagnes d informations plus vastes et plus generales qui sont envisagees dans cette proposition
french d apr s ce projet de recommandation chaque plan doit definir la region geographique qu il couvre couvrir une periode de temps definie inclure des dispositions specifiques sa revision identifier les sites ou types d installations specifiques concernes etablir les programmes des inspections environnementales reguli res prevoir et exposer dans les grandes lignes les procedures liees aux inspections environnementales ponctuelles et prevoir la coordination entre les differentes autorites d inspection
french je voudrais feliciter le rapporteur caroline jackson pour son rapport
french elle y demande que la proposition soit convertie en une directive qui serait appliquee uniformement au sein de toute l union europeenne
french le rapporteur pense que seule une directive peut obliger les etats membres introduire ces syst mes d inspection
french en tant que membre de la commission de l environnement de la sante publique et de la politique des consommateurs du parlement europeen je soutiens le besoin des etats membres d etablir des inspections environnementales harmonisees
french le conseil europeen doit suivre l avis du parlement europeen en la mati re
french nous ne devons pas oublier que dans les questions environnementales le parlement europeen dispose du pouvoir de codecision qui decoule de l application des dispositions du traite d amsterdam
french l union europeenne a egalement une competence dans les questions environnementales conformement l article du traite de maastricht
french conseil europeen des et juin santa maria da feira
french el il y a quatre observations importantes formuler sur la presidence portugaise et le sommet de santa maria da feira qui la cl ture
french premi rement l union europeenne a fait un nouveau pas dangereux vers la militarisation en encourageant l organisation d une force militaire et polici re de l union europeenne et le developpement d un cadre atlantique dans lequel elle se meut
french pourtant il y a eu au contraire une carence en actions positives en faveur de la paix comme en temoigne la poursuite de l enlisement en yougoslavie
french deuxi mement la cig a encourage des developpements plus orientes vers l europe deux vitesses que vers la democratisation comme en temoignent la constante reference la cooperation renforcee et les diverses propositions de reduction du poids des petits pays tant au conseil qu la commission
french troisi mement l union europeenne notamment sous la pression du royaume uni n a abouti ni un accord precis ni un calendrier contraignant relativement l information fiscale laissant ainsi libres les paradis fiscaux au sein de l union
french quatri mement le sommet de lisbonne mi chemin du mandat de la presidence portugaise a donne un nouveau signe de l abandon du mod le europeen relatif l etat providence et de l alignement sur le mod le americain
french les deputes sociaux democrates danois du parlement europeen ont ce jour vote pour la resolution relative aux conclusions du conseil europeen qui s est tenu feira les et juin
french nous avons pris cette decision parce que nous tenons remercier la presidence d avoir mis en x uvre comme le refl te egalement le chapitre de la resolution relatif au suivi du sommet de lisbonne un programme valable et progressiste pour l europe
french notre vote global ne peut toutefois tre per u comme un soutien au souhait d elargir le programme de la conference intergouvernementale et d inclure dans le traite la charte des droits fondamentaux avec effet legal nous vous renvoyons ce propos aux explications de vote que nous avons rendues l occasion du sommet de helsinki de la convocation de la conference intergouvernementale de la position du parlement europeen par rapport la conference intergouvernementale et de la preparation du sommet de feira
french je n ai pas pu voter en faveur de la resolution de compromis notamment parce que le paragraphe sur la taxation est un peu trop maigre et porte un jugement truque sur ce qui a vraiment ete decide feira
french ce parlement aurait mieux fait de constater avec satisfaction bien s r la determination des chefs d etat et de gouvernement d arriver un accord integral sur l ensemble du paquet fiscal imposition des revenus de l epargne fiscalite des entreprises inter ts et redevances au plus tard la fin de
french on aurait d confirmer la necessite de preserver la competitivite des marches financiers europeens par l adoption simultanee de mesures equivalentes dans les principaux pays tiers et de mesures identiques dans les territoires dependants ou associes
french on aurait d aussi demander tre saisi des rapports que la commission devra presenter intervalles reguliers sur l application des syst mes d echange d informations et de retenue la source en mati re de fiscalite de l epargne ainsi que du rapport sur la base duquel l adoption et la mise en x uvre de la directive seront decidees
french je rappelle que tel n a pas ete le cas
french je sais que les avis sur le compromis fiscal negocie l arrache feira sont tr s partages
french ils se refl tent dans toute la presse europeenne
french je ne peux m emp cher de citer quelques titres compromis dilatoire sur la fiscalite de l epargne doutes sur le compromis fiscal de feira accord de fa ade et divergences persistantes accord boiteux retenue la source coexistence rien du tout
french ou en allemand schotte brown st rkt finansplatz london
french london setzt sich im eu steuerstreit durch schweizer banken sehen keinen handlungsbedarf bevor das bankgeheimnis f llt mussen alle finanzpl tze mitmachen
french la constatation du basler zeitung du juin dernier en dit long egalement eher wird das matterhorn abgebrochen als dass die stimmburgerschaft der schweiz das bankpersonal von der schweigepflicht entbindet und den finanzminister in bern zum steuereintreiber brussels macht
french dans ce contexte le titre de l echo du juin qui constate avec raison que sans garanties suffisantes luxembourg bloquera la directive sur la fiscalite et que l echange d informations devra aussi tre applique par les places concurrentes refl te ce qui a vraiment ete decide feira
french le fait que notre resolution se plaint du calendrier de feira illustre l ignorance ou l illusion des redacteurs de ce passage qui je voudrais rappeler ce que le premier ministre luxembourgeois a tenu preciser ce sujet feira savoir qu en mati re de fiscalite de l epargne il y a encore une cinquantaine de questions techniques dont le conseil n a jamais discute
french reprocher dans ce contexte au calendrier de ne pas refleter l urgence du probl me est d un irrealisme irresponsable
french une expression surprenante est venue sur les l vres du dernier president du conseil lorsqu il nous a presente lundi soir le bilan de la presidence portugaise
french il ne faut pas a declare le premier ministre antonio guterres laisser s installer une derive intergouvernementale
french il faut que le debat sur l europe federale qui vient d tre relance soit mene dans sa globalite
french n est il pas paradoxal de voir le representant des gouvernements des etats membres denoncer le risque de derive intergouvernementale de l union europeenne
french le paradoxe est d autant plus fort que ce qui eclate aujourd hui aux yeux de tous ou presque c est au contraire l impasse laquelle conduisent immanquablement les formules federales et notamment la derni re en date celle des cooperations renforcees pour tenter de resoudre l insurmontable contradiction entre federalisme et elargissement la formule miracle des cooperations renforcees a ete particuli rement mise en avant tout au long de la presidence portugaise
french elle a ete presentee ici m me mardi par le president chirac comme une sorte de solution universelle avec une avant garde de pays pionniers tra ant le chemin de tous
french notons au passage propos d avant garde la reapparition dans le cadre du federalisme europeen d expressions qui ont connu jadis une grande fortune dans d autres contextes ideologiques
french la mise en avant sur le mode lyrico ideologique d une telle formule dissimule les dangers reels que contient la generalisation du principe de la majorite qualifiee et donc l elimination de la r gle de l unanimite
french non seulement les cooperations renforcees sont elles vigoureusement denoncees et juste titre par les etats membres petits et moyens comme attentatoires leur dignite alors que la souverainete est un principe garantissant l egalite et le respect de chacun
french mais l interieur m me des cooperations renforcees on voit bien que l application du principe de la majorite au lieu de l unanimite risque de creer des tensions insoutenables en conferant un monopole de fait des decisions un seul pays dominant
french de telle sorte qu il appara t bien que le principe de la majorite qualifiee s il est inapplicable l est tout autant ou
french la solution miracle se rev le tre en fait une double source de tensions risquant d affecter profondement la cooperation europeenne
french c est pourquoi en lieu et place des cooperations renforcees qui seraient necessairement un facteur de tensions dangereuses nous proposons des cooperations differenciees conclues entre etats souverains libres de decider de conclure les accords qu ils veulent dans les domaines qu ils souhaitent pourvu que ceux ci ne l sent pas les inter ts fondamentaux de leurs partenaires
french traite des tres humains
french les deputees de lutte ouvri re partagent l indignation exprimee par la proposition de la gue que nous avons votee devant la mort des immigres de douvres et de tant d autres qui ont tente de franchir les fronti res exterieures ou interieures de l union europeenne
french pour mettre fin une situation o la mis re chasse des milliers d tres humains vers des contrees o ils esp rent vivre un peu mieux il faudrait mettre fin un syst me social qui pour polariser des richesses inou es entre quelques mains impose la pauvrete la majorite de la plan te
french ce n est evidemment pas un vote du parlement qui aboutira ce bouleversement necessite pourtant vitale pour l humanite
french il est revoltant que m me dans les domaines o les institutions actuelles nationales et europeennes pourraient faire quelque chose elles ne le font pas
french le drame de douvres s est produit entre deux pays de l europe
french les barbeles qu on est en train d installer autour de l union europeenne subsistent m me l interieur pour les ressortissants des pays tiers et ces barri res peuvent tuer
french il ne suffit pas de denoncer les crapules qui s enrichissent en se livrant au trafic des tres humains
french il faut assurer aux immigres des droits qui devraient tre ceux de tout tre humain
french il faut assurer la libre circulation des personnes
french il faut mettre fin aux politiques d immigration qui transforment les immigres en sous hommes prives de droits si ce n est en clandestins gibier de la police
french nous tenons protester vigoureusement contre la politique du gouvernement fran ais qui se compla t dans son r le de president de l union europeenne mais qui refuse de regulariser travailleurs immigres devenus des sans papiers la suite de lois iniques et nous exigeons leur regularisation immediate
french monsieur le president je ferai mon explication de vote par ecrit
french neanmoins puis je faire une motion de procedure
french dans le temps lorsqu on etait present lors du vote et qu on faisait une explication de vote par ecrit on pouvait s en aller parce que le president communiquait avoir sur tel rapport telle et telle explication de vote ecrite
french maintenant on doit attendre
french hier j ai attendu minutes pour dire que je faisais mon explication de vote par ecrit
french c est du temps perdu
french ce que nous faisons est pourtant dej un peu inhumain nous votons de heures h et apr s nous restons ici jusqu heures pour dire qu on fait une explication de vote par ecrit
french les services m ont dit qu il fallait tre ici
french peut tre l auriez vous accepte neanmoins ne pourrait on pas clarifier les choses
french je veux bien que ceux qui ne participent pas au vote sur un rapport ou une resolution ne puissent pas faire d explication ecrite mais ceux qui ont participe au vote qui donnent leur explication ecrite pourquoi doivent ils rester encore une demi heure ici
french ne pouvez vous pas clarifier cela
french madame lulling qui en voulez vous
french aux coll gues qui donnent une explication de vote
french si tous ceux qui sont ici le faisaient par ecrit vous auriez pu le faire avant
french vos coll gues ont de toute fa on le droit d expliquer leur vote sur tous les rapports que nous mettons aux voix
french monsieur le president je voudrais commenter les points et qui avancent que la conference intergouvernementale est l element important de l elargissement
french ce n est pas le cas
french l element important est avant tout la mani re dont les negociations avec les pays candidats se deroulent et le resultat obtenu
french l heure actuelle aucune date de fin n a ete fixee et les pays candidats trouvent que l ue est tr s imprecise quant sa position
french je voudrais egalement commenter le point dont le contenu implique mon sens une evolution malheureuse vers une militarisation de l union europeenne
french je le dis egalement en tant que representant d un pays neutre
french je voudrais finalement commenter le point lequel parle d un pas en avant positif vers une coordination fiscale en europe
french qu est ce pour une declaration
french je voudrais citer ce propos la constitution suedoise et ses propres termes le droit tr s ancien du peuple suedois se taxer
french la seance suspendue h est reprise heures
french debat d actualite
french l ordre du jour appelle le debat sur des probl mes d actualite urgents et d importance majeure
french la parole est m maaten pour un rappel au r glement
french madame la presidente je prends volontiers la parole lors de l ouverture du debat d actualite parce que je pense consulter l article du r glement que le moment est opportun
french l ordre du jour mentionne en effet une resolution sur l euro et les hooligans et bien que nous desirions discuter de cette affaire certains elements font actuellement toujours l objet d une enqu te menee par les autorites judiciaires des pays bas
french nous pensons donc qu il est premature d emettre un jugement ce sujet alors que l enqu te n est pas terminee
french c est pourquoi je voudrais proposer sur la base de l article de reporter notre periode de session de septembre la discussion relative cette resolution
french ledit article precise egalement que pareille requ te doit immediatement faire l objet d un vote
french cher coll gue premi rement l article dont vous parlez ne fait reference qu un groupe ou deputes
french deuxi mement il ne concerne pas directement la question des urgences puisque le principe m me de nos urgences est de deliberer en debut de periode de session pour fixer le cadre de celles ci
french ce n est pas comme un renvoi en commission
french par consequent soit l urgence est acceptee soit elle est refusee
french si elle est acceptee nous devons aller au bout de la procedure et le debat doit avoir lieu
french madame la presidente je vous demanderai de transmettre mme fontaine pour qu elle fasse le necessaire aupr s des institutions pertinentes la grande preoccupation qui r gne dans la baie d algeciras cause de la presence depuis plus de deux mois d un sous marin nucleaire du royaume uni le hm tireless en panne semblerait il cause d un tr s grave probl me dans le syst me de refrigeration
french il semblerait d apr s les derni res nouvelles que l on voudrait le reparer cet endroit m me
french les habitants de la zone ont exprime leur opposition totale via une resolution conjointe de tous les groupes politiques approuvee aujourd hui m me ce que cette reparation se fasse l bas
french au sein de cette assemblee nous invitons instamment le gouvernement britannique remorquer immediatement ce machin hors de la baie et le reparer en angleterre o les installations appropries cette reparation sont nous supposons disponibles
french cher coll gue votre intervention sera transmise mme fontaine qui j en suis s re y sera attentive
french madame la presidente plusieurs groupes soutiennent la requ te de m maaten il a parle au nom du groupe eldr et je me rallie sa requ te au nom du groupe edd
french je vous demande donc de proceder au vote conformement au r glement
french non monsieur blokland le r glement ne prevoit pas qu on puisse mettre aux voix le report d une urgence
french le cas des urgences est tr s particulier
french il a ete mis aux voix lundi et l assemblee souveraine en a fixe le cadre
french partir du moment o c est une urgence elle ne peut tre reportee
french bien evidemment l ensemble des arguments que vous et m maaten avez developpes pourront tre consideres pendant le debat mais je ne mets pas aux voix la remise plus tard de ce debat
french madame la presidente vous presentez les choses d une certaine mani re mais j ai consulte le texte et celui ci ne mentionne aucunement l existence d exceptions pour les debats d urgence
french en fait chaque sujet place lundi l ordre du jour par l assemblee peut tre reporte par celle ci dans le courant de la semaine la lumi re de nouveaux arguments
french or il y a de nouveaux arguments dans le cas present
french nous avons appris entre temps que la justice neerlandaise a ouvert une enqu te
french il me semble evident que lorsque nous avons decide d aborder ce sujet lundi ces informations nous etaient inconnues
french nous disposons present de nouvelles donnees dont nous devons tenir compte
french je pense d s lors que votre explication du r glement ne correspond pas la lettre du r glement
french je crois monsieur blokland que mon interpretation correspond la lettre et l esprit de notre r glement
french il est clairement dit que l ordre du jour puisqu il s agit de l etablissement de l ordre du jour est etabli par notre assemblee en debut de periode de session ce qui a ete fait
french independamment de cela si des elements nouveaux sont apportes vous pourrez les transmettre au cours du debat et cela eclairera le vote de nos coll gues
french mais je maintiens cette interpretation qui est la fois liee au principe de l ordre du jour et au principe des urgences
french madame la presidente j interviens seulement pour m associer aux propos de mon coll gue du parti andalou d andalousie et suggerer comme lieu de reparation du sous marin atomique britannique les jardins du palais de buckingham o ils peuvent ramener l animal
french chers coll gues l ensemble des arguments ont ete developpes sur cette affaire de report
french je maintiens ma position et je vous propose maintenant de passer directement au debat car nos coll gues l attendent concernant les les fidji et salomon
french les fidji et salomon
french l ordre du jour appelle en discussion commune les propositions de resolution suivantes
french b de m speroni au nom du groupe technique des deputes independants sur les les fidji
french b de mme ludford au nom du groupe du parti europeen des liberaux democrates et reformateurs sur la situation aux fidji et dans les les salomon
french b de mm corrie et johan van hecke au nom du groupe du parti populaire europeen democrates chretiens et des democrates europeens sur la situation aux fidji et dans les les salomon
french b de m marset campos au nom du groupe confederal de la gauche unitaire europeenne gauche verte nordique sur la situation aux fidji et dans les les salomon
french b de m lucas au nom du groupe des verts alliance libre europeenne sur la situation aux fidji
french b de m lucas au nom du groupe des verts alliance libre europeenne sur la situation dans les les salomon
french b de mm van den berg et kinnock au nom du groupe du parti des socialistes europeens sur les les fidji et salomon
french madame la presidente ce qui se passe actuellement aux les fidji prouve une fois de plus que les illusions pathetiques de ceux qui croient en la societe multiethnique et multiraciale ne trouvent pas de reponse dans les faits
french nous voyons en effet que le conflit dans ces les entre l ethnie autochtone et l ethnie immigree a explose de mani re peu sanglante certes mais neanmoins impressionnante
french il se produit la m me chose aux les salomon voisines ou dans d autres regions du monde
french il suffit de penser la region des grands lacs africains l le de timor ou aux moluques o les faits nous montrent que la cohabitation entre des communautes aux traditions cultures et histoires tout fait differentes ne se refl te pas dans la realite au del des bonnes intentions de ceux qui souhaitent la mondialisation totale m me dans ce domaine
french il faut donc selon moi insister sur la protection des ethnies indig nes pour eviter que les fidjiens d origine subissent le m me sort que les indiens d amerique du sud centrale ou du nord et veiller ce que leur culture soit preservee travers un contr le de l immigration sauvage pour que ce qui se passe l bas ne se produise pas comme cela a malheureusement dej ete le cas dans les balkans sur notre continent
french madame la presidente c est juste titre que nous sommes au sein du parlement particuli rement attentifs aux regions dans lesquelles les tensions ethniques conduisent des conflits et des tentatives de renversement de la democratie et de l etat de droit
french que ce soit dans les les fidji ou salomon le gouvernement democratique et l ordre public ont ete ebranles
french l objectif dans les les fidji doit tre de restaurer le gouvernement legitime elu sur la base de la constitution multiraciale de qui a ete approuvee par les deux groupes ethniques les indo fidjiens et les fidjiens indig nes
french il faut mettre un terme la violence l encontre des biens et des personnes et obtenir la liberation des otages
french l administration civile transitoire mise en place dans les les fidji ne repond pas aux tests constitutionnels et democratiques
french nous demandons d s lors la commission qu elle mette en x uvre avec determination des procedures visant suspendre la cooperation au developpement avec les les fidji
french les habitants accables des les fidji attendent que l union europeenne qu ils consid rent comme le flambeau de la democratie et de l egalite raciale vienne leur secours
french nous avertissons egalement les les salomon qu une suspension de l aide pourrait s averer necessaire afin de restaurer la democratie la paix et la stabilite
french madame la presidente je voudrais concentrer mon attention sur le cas des les salomon mais d abord dire un mot propos des les fidji
french le vice president acp ue fait partie des personnes actuellement detenues en otage et je voudrais vous demander d adresser une lettre de soutien sa famille
french la delegation acp ue s est rendue dans les les salomon pour etudier la tension ethnique
french il etait relativement evident apr s les discussions qu un coup d etat etait imminent
french pourquoi est ce arrive
french lorsque nous sommes arrives nous avons ete confrontes un vide total
french il n y avait aucun dialogue entre les parties en conflit
french le parlement ne fonctionnait pas
french il n y avait pas d ordre public car ceux qui appartenaient la police le jour se transformaient en militants malaitans la nuit et ont ouverts leurs dep ts d armes aux malaitans le jour du coup d etat
french le groupe imf detient de guadalcanal et seule honiara city est aux mains des malaitans
french cette situation est intenable
french le conflit ethnique est enti rement d l expulsion de guadalcanal de malaitans vers leur le d origine vers une terrible pauvrete sans aucune compensation
french comme ils ont fait tout le travail guadalcanal est maintenant paralysee tant dans les regions rurales qu urbaines
french la presence de mme kinnock et moi m me a eu une influence favorable sur la situation
french nous avons etabli un dialogue
french nous avons obtenu le retrait de la demande de demission apr s heures du premier ministre
french nous leur avons conseille de convoquer le parlement et d avoir un debat sur la situation et celui ci a maintenant eu lieu
french de mani re assez surprenante le chef de l opposition est maintenant devenu premier ministre
french tout cela est arrive parce que nous avons signale que l union europeenne pourrait suspendre son aide si le coup d etat se faisait sous la menace des armes
french cette aide represente de leur pib
french mais le pays est ruine et le nouveau premier ministre sera confronte aux m mes probl mes que son predecesseur
french il doit rendre la structure parlementaire plus active travailler en vue d un cessez le feu et engager ensuite des discussions sur l octroi d une compensation avec l aide exterieure
french celle ci sera egalement necessaire pour restaurer l ordre public
french je voudrais terminer en remerciant les membres de la delegation l bas qui nous ont ete d un tr s grand secours
french madame la presidente chers coll gues le pacifique il est vrai evoque toujours des images paradisiaques plages cocotiers soleil
french aujourd hui la realite est beaucoup plus triste
french les deux coups d etat survenus ces derniers temps fidji rev lent en fait des etats instables et divises par la pauvrete
french l incroyable dans cette affaire est outre la passivite de nos institutions que l on prend toujours le pretexte de tensions interethniques pour expliquer ces conflits
french or on se rend bien compte que les veritables causes ne sont pas que l
french aux salomon la tr s grande majorite de la population est melanesienne et chretienne
french fidji pr s de la moitie de la population est d origine indienne mais cette origine remonte au si cle passe
french et malgre ces differences chacun est chez lui fidji
french je crois qu il y a d autres causes que ces conflits ethniques
french on nie par exemple le r le joue par ceux qui tirent profit de ces conflits multinationales et hommes politiques locaux
french pour les premi res les periodes d instabilite signifient moins d obligations en mati re sociale de fiscalite d environnement parce que l etat est alors tr s faible et les conflits favorisent l industrie de l armement parce qu il faudra bien armer les groupes politiques
french pour les hommes politiques la pratique qui consiste monter les uns contre les autres comme le fait par exemple l extr me droite chez nous permet de se creer un espace politique ou de maintenir en place le pouvoir
french cette pratique n est possible que parce que la population est pauvre et qu elle souffre d un manque de connaissance de l autre
french dans le cas present les deux conflits auraient d permettre certains de se remettre en selle ou de prendre un pouvoir qu ils n arrivaient pas avoir par les urnes
french fidji le coup d etat a ete fomente par un homme d affaires en faillite qui a joue sur ses lointaines origines fidjiennes pour legitimer son action
french quant au nouveau premier ministre il est egalement issu du milieu des affaires
french aux salomon un simulacre de vote du parlement a porte au pouvoir un nouveau premier ministre elu gr ce aux fusils
french ces deux exemples etayent bien notre vision du conflit
french la resolution commune se veut cependant trop moralisatrice et demande de fait de revenir la situation anterieure
french comme c est trop souvent le cas elle ne revient pas sur les veritables sources de ces conflits la pauvrete et le r le sous jacent et interesse d acteurs economiques et politiques
french de ce point de vue si on veut tre veritablement efficaces il faut prevenir les nouveaux conflits et pour cela veritablement aider au developpement de l education de l economie locale et de la democratie locale
french c est ainsi qu on arrivera peut tre faire changer les choses
french madame la presidente je voudrais commenter la question des les fidji
french il y a quelques jours quelques indo fidjiens ethniques representant cette communaute et la diaspora indienne qui sont affectes par ces conflits sont venus au parlement
french ils ont exprime leur plus profonde inquietude quant la situation dans les les fidji son symbolisme et la mani re dont elle pourrait affecter les communautes indiennes dans d autres regions du monde
french leur inquietude ne concernait pas precisement la communaute indienne ethnique mais plut t les les fidji
french celles ci se sont octroye une constitution multiraciale en
french elle a ete elaboree en vue de resoudre les probl mes ethniques de ces les y compris le probl me des terres et cette constitution a ete approuvee l unanimite par le parlement domine par les fidjiens ethniques et reconnue par le grand conseil des chefs
french c etait un mod le de constitution pour une societe multiraciale et une le prosp re
french il est clair que l anarchie et la violence ont affaibli cette constitution mais nous devons chercher plus loin les causes du conflit
french dans les pays auxquels nous accordons une aide le parlement doit veiller ce que nous surveillions la degradation de l ordre public et veillions aux inter ts des minorites ethniques qui sont en danger
french les inquietudes exprimees sont plus que reelles
french nous avons toujours la possibilite de suspendre l aide si nous croyons que quelque chose ne tourne pas rond aux les fidji
french glenys kinnock et moi m me ainsi que d autres coll gues qui avons rencontre la communaute ethnique indienne voulons les aider trouver une solution ce conflit
french madame la presidente mesdames et messieurs la commission observe avec une inquietude croissante les evenements qui se deroulent depuis le mai dans les les fidji
french il est vraiment decourageant de constater quel point les acquis d une decennie enti re sont aujourd hui menaces
french il y avait une constitution qui ne reposait pas sur le racisme
french elle est abrogee
french les les fidji avaient un gouvernement democratiquement elu
french il a ete renverse et remplace par un gouvernement civil de transition nomme par l armee
french les les fidji commencent dej subir d enormes dommages economiques
french elles risquent une perte de confiance des investisseurs
french sur le plan politique les les fidji qui en toute fierte voulaient donner leur nom au nouvel accord de partenariat negocie pour ans entre les pays acp et l ue risquent de degrader considerablement leurs relations avec la communaute internationale
french elles risquent m me d tre exclues du commonwealth
french la commission prepare en ce moment une proposition au conseil sur le recours l article a de la convention de lome car elle est d avis que les principes fondamentaux de la convention democratie etat de droit respect des droits de l homme ne sont plus garantis dans les les fidji
french je voudrais rappeler que cette disposition prevoit tout d abord la consultation entre les parties
french des mesures supplementaires et des sanctions ne seront debattues dans un second temps qu en fonction des resultats des consultations et de leur mise en x uvre
french c est la raison pour laquelle il est pour l instant trop t t pour evaluer d autres mesures et les sanctions prendre
french toute reponse devrait tre bien reflechie et atteindre les resultats escomptes
french nous devrions eviter les effets qu a eu une interdiction de commerce exigee par les syndicats en australie et en nouvelle zelande savoir le licenciement de travailleurs du secteur de l habillement et du tourisme
french j en viens present aux les salomon ici aussi la commission observe avec inquietude la degradation des conditions de securite
french la commission soutient tous les efforts entrepris par les mediateurs pour faire en sorte que les questions ouvertes et les divergences de vue des parties concernees puissent tre debattues ouvertement et sans menace de recours la violence
french la commission tient disposition ses instruments permettant de soutenir le processus de paix d s que la situation politique et les conditions de securite le permettront
french la discussion commune est close
french le vote aura lieu h
french tibet
french l ordre du jour appelle en discussion commune les propositions de resolution suivantes
french b de m pannella et autres au nom du groupe technique des deputes independants sur la necessite d arr ter la colonisation chinoise et d adopter un nouveau statut pour le tibet
french b de mme sanders ten holte au nom du groupe du parti europeen des liberaux democrates et reformateurs sur l urgente necessite de negociations sino tibetaines en vue de l adoption d un nouveau statut pour le tibet
french b de mme muscardini et m collins au nom du groupe union pour l europe des nations sur le tibet
french b de mm thomas mann et bowis au nom du groupe du parti populaire europeen democrates chretiens et democrates europeens sur le projet de reduction de la pauvrete en chine occidentale et l avenir du tibet
french b de m messner et mme frassoni au nom du groupe des verts alliance libre europeenne sur l urgente necessite de negociations sino tibetaines en vue de l adoption d un nouveau statut pour le tibet
french b de mm sakellariou et veltroni au nom du groupe du parti des socialistes europeens sur le tibet
french madame la presidente monsieur le commissaire chers coll gues je pense que nous nous appr tons voter un texte important sur le tibet et que nous avons la possibilite aujourd hui de faire un saut qualitatif dans cette bataille fondamentale
french c est une bataille de droit et de droit international
french le tibet est occupe le tibet a ete envahi par les troupes chinoises en et depuis lors il est occupe et colonise par les chinois
french je pense que nous devons voter bien s r massivement pour cette resolution mais que nous devons aussi voter pour l amendement qui a ete depose par m thomas mann par le groupe liberal et par le groupe des verts amendement qui demande nos gouvernements de prendre en consideration la possibilite de reconna tre le gouvernement tibetain en exil si dans un delai de trois ans les autorites chinoises et le gouvernement tibetain en exil n ont pas finalement conclu un accord sur une autonomie substantielle du tibet
french nous ne pouvons plus laisser la seule bonne et dans ce cas ci la tr s mauvaise volonte des autorites de pekin la pleine latitude de ne pas affronter ce probl me
french nous devons les obliger nous devons affirmer par l action politique de notre parlement notre volonte que finalement cette question qui dure depuis ans soit resolue
french je voudrais lancer un appel particulier aux amis de la gauche aux amis socialistes aux amis communistes ne continuez pas avoir deux poids deux mesures
french nous nous rappelons tous les grandes batailles pour la decolonisation de l afrique la liberation de l algerie du vietnam
french avec les resultats que l on voit aujourd hui ce dernier pays est toujours aux mains d un syst me totalitaire dictatorial
french il y a aujourd hui au tibet une lutte non violente pour la democratie
french il n y a aucune raison de ne pas faire ici ce que nous avons fait l nombreux dans ces annees l
french il faut aujourd hui que la question du tibet devienne une question de droit une question d affirmation de la non violence par la communaute internationale
french la chine est un grand pays qui a droit la democratie
french c est evident mais cela ne peut pas tre une raison pour sacrifier encore le droit des tibetains vivre avec leur propre culture dans une pleine autonomie dans tous les domaines qui doivent regir les peuples
french j invite donc tr s sinc rement les amis socialistes et les amis communistes voter pour cette resolution et cet amendement faire en sorte que notre parlement soit une fois au moins l avant garde de cette bataille de la liberte de la democratie et de la non violence
french madame la presidente joyeux anniversaire au dala lama
french j ignore toutefois si ce jour est reellement synonyme de joie pour lui etant donne que la principale contribution de l union europeenne au monde consiste monter aux creneaux pour defendre le respect des droits de l homme et de la democratie lesquels ne sont toujours pas respectes au tibet
french sous cet angle je voudrais soulever les questions suivantes
french premi rement pour quelles raisons n y a t il toujours pas de veritable dialogue officiel entre le gouvernement chinois et le gouvernement tibetain en exil
french tous ces contacts indirects ne m nent rien
french par le biais du parlement europeen nous devons adopter une position plus ferme pour soutenir le principe de non violence d o cette resolution
french deuxi mement pour quelles raisons une institution renommee telle que la banque mondiale est elle sur le point de financer un programme chinois qui implique une vulgaire colonisation du tibet
french nous devons emp cher cela d o cette resolution
french troisi mement pour quelles raisons l union europeenne laisse t elle prevaloir les inter ts economiques dans la relation qu elle entretient avec la chine
french il est intolerable d accorder notre attention au peuple tibetain uniquement quand cela nous sied
french en conclusion madame la presidente je vous demande de veiller ce qu un veritable dialogue soit instaure conformement aux directives du plan de paix en cinq points du dala lama ce sera alors un jour heureux pour tout le peuple tibetain
french monsieur le president monsieur le commissaire verheugen mesdames et messieurs la banque mondiale prend demain une decision d une importance capitale pour le tibet
french dans l ouest de la chine l aide internationale doit permettre de reduire la pauvrete et qui ne serait pas pr t aider ceux qui ne peuvent subvenir leurs besoins
french dans le cadre de ce projet personnes doivent cependant tre deplacees au tibet savoir dans une proportion qui conduira ce que les tibetains deviennent progressivement une minorite sur leur propre territoire et ce apr s des decennies de destruction de leur culture leurs monast res apr s des poursuites et des menaces de mort
french les membres de notre intergroupe tibet et beaucoup d autres deputes europeens se sont adresses il y jours au president de la banque mondiale washington afin que celle ci ne bafoue pas ses propres principes pour la protection des populations menacees
french nous avons ecrit aux parlements nationaux aux ministres des finances en europe aux usa aux autres continents et bien entendu au commissaire patten
french nous avons demande au conseil d administration de la banque mondiale de d abord etudier dans le detail le rapport des inspecteurs independants
french ces derniers emettent de graves reserves quant savoir si ce transfert de population en raison d un programme d irrigation est justifie sur le plan ecologique ou supportable sur le plan social
french lorsque des fonds publics sont utilises la justification de telles depenses doit tre publiee
french renforcee par son adhesion prochaine l omc la chine est de plus en plus consciente de son futur r le de puissance mondiale comme j ai pu m en apercevoir recemment pekin
french il est en m me temps de son devoir d agir de mani re plus responsable qu auparavant et par exemple de mettre en x uvre le concept une chine plusieurs syst mes
french l autonomie totale promise au tibet doit enfin tre assuree
french elle implique la liberte de culte la liberte d opinion et le respect des particularites culturelles et sociales
french il convient de mener les dialogues bilateraux avec les responsables autorises
french le dala lama y est pr t tout moment
french ce prix nobel cette personnalite reconnue dans le monde entier cel bre aujourd hui ma coll gue l a dej signale son e anniversaire et est depuis ans le plus haut responsable du tibet
french son plan de paix en cinq points qui illustre la voie non violente qu il preconise continue de prevaloir
french il est grand temps qu un dialogue constructif soit mene sur cette base
french au nom du groupe ppe et de l intergroupe tibet j appelle tous les membres du parlement europeen soutenir notre resolution
french seul une protestation mondiale peu avant la decision de la banque mondiale savoir demain peut emp cher une evolution nefaste et lourde de consequences

french madame la presidente monsieur le commissaire chers coll gues nous sommes sur le point d adopter pour la treizi me fois une resolution sur le tibet et si nous nous penchons sur les resultats force nous est d admettre qu ils sont particuli rement maigres
french c est la raison pour laquelle je m adresse au commissaire
french je voudrais que l union europeenne et ses trois puissantes institutions s adressent d une seule et m me voix l opinion mondiale aux autorites chinoises et la banque mondiale en particulier
french mes coll gues l ont d ores et dej souligne nous devons mettre un terme cette colonisation interne ce meurtre cruel de l individualite culturelle du peuple tibetain
french nous ne pouvons y parvenir que si la banque mondiale cesse de financer des projets qui ne vont pas dans ce sens c est dire des projets qui permettent aux chinois d importer leurs produits au tibet en vue de detruire la culture d origine
french nous ne pouvons pas depenser l argent du contribuable cet effet
french j esp re que vous collaborerez egalement l amorce d un changement de cap comme le demandent mes coll gues dans l amendement qui prevoit que si aucun changement n est observe dans les trois ans venir nous finirons par reconna tre le gouvernement provisoire du tibet au lieu de continuer trepigner sur place
french nous estimons qu il est primordial que le parlement se prononce contre cette decision de la banque mondiale nous soulignons que les gouvernements doivent faire tout leur possible et deployer tous les moyens egalement les moyens economiques dont nous disposons vu que la chine voudrait adherer l omc etc
french etc pour que ce pays respecte l autonomie du tibet et pour que reprennent au plus vite les pourparlers entre le gouvernement chinois et le dala lama visant determiner un nouveau statut pour le tibet comme il ressort du premier point de nos conclusions sur cette resolution
french ces negociations devraient se baser on l a dej rappele sur les cinq points du programme du dala lama que nous soutenons et qui nous souhaitons un joyeux anniversaire
french madame la presidente ans apr s nous avons celebre ces derni res annees la fin de la guerre la creation des nations unies la creation de l organisation mondiale de la sante le retour l independance des pays de la baltique par rapport l empire sovietique mais malheureusement ans apr s nous devons egalement commemorer l occupation illegale du tibet par la chine cinquante ans de repression et d oppression du peuple tibetain par le regime chinois
french il ne faut jamais permettre que cela devienne un fait accompli d o l amendement cette resolution pour mettre la pression sur la chine que je soutiens vivement
french d o egalement la resolution globale pour demander la banque mondiale qu elle retire son soutien nos pretendus projets qui impliqueraient le deplacement de quelque chinois dans une region actuellement habitee par tibetains vivant de leur cheptel et l exploitation des ressources naturelles du tibet
french ces actions sont immorales toutes deux vont l encontre du droit international toutes deux requi rent une action de la part de ce parlement et de l union en faveur du tibet et de sa population
french monsieur le president pour commencer je voudrais preciser que je parle aujourd hui au nom de la gauche verte nordique
french nous pensons que les tibetains doivent obtenir l autonomie laquelle ils aspirent
french par ailleurs nous sommes inquiets de la reticence de la chine prendre part un dialogue
french je voudrais m adresser au commissaire et lui dire que j esp re que la commission a beaucoup de bons contacts avec le representant de la banque mondiale
french la decision doit tre prise d s demain
french nous avons donc tr s peu de temps pour convaincre la banque mondiale tout comme cette resolution s y applique
french il est generalement tr s difficile d influencer la banque mondiale
french je voudrais donc avoir un rapport pour savoir si ces institutions ont en general la possibilite de le faire ou si nous devons chercher toute la nuit convaincre notre representant gouvernemental
french le conseil n est en grande partie pas present ici
french madame la presidente j ai eu l occasion de verifier personnellement la situation au tibet une situation bien plus grave humiliante et douloureuse que tout ce qui peut tre exprime en ce parlement ou dans une autre assemblee
french ces quarante derni res annees les chinois ont vraiment nie la liberte des tibetains efface l identite de ce peuple et surtout viole ses droits et sa dignite
french voil pourquoi il est necessaire qu un parlement aussi sensible aux droits de l homme et la lutte contre la xenophobie et le racisme exige que la chine negocie un nouveau statut prevoyant la reconnaissance des droits du peuple tibetain un statut lui garantissant la pleine autonomie
french je voudrais tre claire quitte risquer de susciter la polemique
french tr ve d hypocrisie il est en effet inutile d adopter comme nous le faisons aujourd hui une resolution petrie de bonnes intentions pleine de belles paroles et m me de critiques si c est pour ensuite que nos ministres ou les maires de nos capitales accueillent les autorites chinoises peut tre pour des motifs economiques et commerciaux avec les plus grands honneurs cela sera le cas demain rome o m rutelli qui en dehors d tre depute europeen est aussi le premier magistrat de cette ville recevra officiellement le premier ministre chinois ou du moins une delegation de ce pays
french je crois que si nous continuons sacrifier les principes et les droits sur l autel de l economie il sera bien difficile au del des declarations d intention qu on peut lancer dans les assemblees parlementaires d arriver une veritable solution pour le peuple tibetain
french madame la presidente tout comme le parlement la commission est tr s inqui te de la situation des droits de l homme au tibet
french notre inquietude concerne plus particuli rement le respect de l identite culturelle linguistique et religieuse de la region autonome du tibet par les autorites chinoises
french nous avons une nouvelle fois souleve ce point dans le cadre du dialogue bilateral avec la chine sur la question des droits de l homme
french l union europeenne a surtout exige que le dialogue avec le dala lama reprenne le plus rapidement possible
french nous sommes d avis que la reprise d un dialogue direct entre le dala lama et les autorites chinoises constitue la seule voix realiste permettant de degager une solution durable et pacifique la question du tibet
french eu egard cette collaboration l union europeenne est d avis que le soutien des projets d aide au tibet est dans l inter t de la population tibetaine pour autant que le groupe ethnique des tibetains profite directement de ces projets et qu il re oive la priorite lors de la gestion de ces projets
french c est exactement ce qui s est passe autrefois gr ce la promesse officielle des autorites chinoises ce sujet
french en ce qui concerne le projet de la banque mondiale je peux vous informer que la commission ne participe par ce projet
french c est pourquoi je ne pense pas que nous pouvons encore avoir de grandes possibilites d influence en toute derni re minute
french si une telle possibilite demeure c est surtout par le biais des etats membres
french droits de l homme

french enfants soldats en ouganda
french madame la presidente monsieur le commissaire beaucoup de choses peuvent tre dites sur cette affaire
french tout d abord j esp re par dessus tout que le conseil et la commission seront actifs au moment d aborder cette question au conseil de securite lorsque le plan d action portant sur les enfants utilises dans les conflits armes sera debattu la fin de ce mois
french d autre part nous avons pu noter aujourd hui avec satisfaction que l on cherche degager une solution commune propos des enfants soldats dans au moins un autre conflit
french cette solution est la resolution dite diamant du conseil de securite
french troisi mement nous pouvons constater que nous avons fait certains progr s generaux en ce qui concerne les enfants soldats
french nous avons le protocole additionnel non gouvernemental portant sur les enfants soldats et les activites en afrique
french je voudrais demander l assemblee de soutenir cette resolution
french j esp re aussi que les etats membres de l ue aborderont ensemble la question au conseil de securite la fin du mois lors de la suite du debat general sur les enfants dans les conflits armes
french madame la presidente la situation dans le nord de l ouganda et dans le sud du soudan donne un aper u du drame des enfants soldats
french cette intervention a pour but l instar de la resolution deposee de pousser le parlement et les institutions europeennes prendre des initiatives plus stables allant au del de l actualite
french le conflit arme est dans cette region une constante des trente derni res annees la societe civile a ete totalement devastee et depuis plus de douze ans divers groupes de rebelles ont perpetre des massacres parmi les populations du nord de l ouganda
french leurs victimes preferees sont les enfants et les adolescents parce qu ils sont plus vulnerables et plus influen ables
french ce jour environ soixante pour cent des soldats de la lord s resistance army sont des enfants de moins de seize ans
french la strategie consiste les manipuler et les brutaliser de sorte en faire des bourreaux leur tour
french les jeunes filles sont donnees comme femmes aux rebelles mais ce qu il faut remarquer c est que l attitude de la lra n a pas evolue m me apr s les accords de nairobi passes entre l ouganda et le soudan en decembre dernier
french j ai eu l occasion ces derniers jours de parler avec une des jeunes filles qui s est enfuie des camps du sud du soudan et qui m a confirme que la lra n a pas la moindre intention de changer de position
french le fait que l on ait celebre aujourd hui en ouganda les funerailles de john baptista ochaia representant du president dans le district de kitgum et mort avant hier la suite de blessures encourues lors d une embuscade de la lra le prouve suffisance
french il est d s lors inacceptable que les autorites europeennes et de nombreuses entreprises commerciales de notre continent ferment les yeux sur cette situation sans vouloir briser le cercle qui vole la vie de toute une generation
french madame la presidente chers coll gues les guerres sont toujours cruelles et les guerres civiles plus horribles encore
french on a pourtant franchi un seuil supplementaire dans la barbarie et l abjection en utilisant des enfants pour se battre pour tuer ou se faire tuer
french ainsi la lra resistance armee n hesite pas kidnapper des gar ons de sept ans les soumettre des brutalites extr mes pour les former se battre et terroriser des villageois
french elle n hesite pas non plus se livrer l exploitation sexuelle des femmes et des jeunes filles
french ces enfants lorsqu ils survivent il faut le savoir sont de toute fa on marques vie
french il faut du temps de la patience de l amour pour leur redonner de l espoir
french c est pour cela qu il faut amplifier l aide et le soutien l unicef qui a mis en place un programme d action permettant des enfants de revenir une vie normale
french il faut egalement madame la presidente arr ter de tergiverser
french le soudan doit cesser son soutien la lra
french il s agit l pour moi d une complicite qui le rend tout aussi coupable
french et le parlement doit intervenir aupr s du gouvernement ougandais pour qu il trouve une solution pacifique ce conflit du nord de l ouganda qui a fait en quinze ans je vous le rappelle morts
french toute la population l attend et tous les enfants l esp rent
french le conseil de securite doit l entendre
french madame la presidente je suis vraiment contente que cette resolution ait abouti
french j esp re que la commission et les etats membres seront invites prendre de reelles decisions sur cette question
french il y a quelques semaines la television suedoise a diffuse un documentaire sur le sud du soudan
french ce documentaire montrait que les investisseurs et compagnies petroli res etrangers dont une de mon pays natal la su de protegeaient les troupes qui utilisaient des enfants soldats
french ces accusations ont egalement ete soutenues par amnesty international qui a explique que les revenus du petrole etaient en outre utilises pour financer la guerre civile dans le sud du soudan
french des enfants soldats d ouganda enr les de force dans les conflits armes y sont utilises
french nous devons mettre la pression sur les compagnies petroli res internationales et sur les investisseurs
french nous devons comme indique dans le point de la resolution encourager vivement ces compagnies mettre un terme leurs activites au soudan jusqu ce que l on ait trouve une solution pacifique au conflit
french madame la presidente je voudrais avant tout exprimer ma reconnaissance envers notre coll gue m van hecke et son epouse mme els de temmerman pour l engagement dont ils ont fait preuve en vue de publier au niveau europeen toutes sortes d informations detaillees sur la question des enfants soldats dans le nord de l ouganda
french en depit de l accord de nairobi signe en il est clair qu on n est pas parvenu appliquer cet accord dans une mesure suffisante
french d o la question relative l influence de l union europeenne et la volonte de tous les etats membres d entreprendre des demarches communes en la mati re
french je voudrais aussi demander concr tement au commissaire verheugen s il compte paralyser et mettre un terme point enonce tr s clairement dans cette resolution aux investissements destines aux puits et aux oleoducs au soudan
french si nous exer ons des pressions en faveur de la pacification et que nous assurons le contr le de cette zone au nord cela permettra de mettre en x uvre des mesures concr tes dans le cadre d une politique exterieure o l aspect humanitaire l aspect des relations exterieures et l aspect commercial vont de pair
french ce type d action est vivement souhaite et ce dans les meilleurs delais
french actuellement nous constatons que ces chiffres et ces exemples ne font qu augmenter mais simultanement nous nous rendons compte que nous exer ons trop peu notre pouvoir dans ce domaine par rapport l usage que nous pourrions en faire
french j en profite egalement pour aborder le th me bien plus vaste des nations unies
french l assemblee generale a adopte le protocole en mai
french le conseil de securite ouvrira les debats en juillet
french ce serait l une occasion r vee pour donner un bel exemple d une europe qui ne se manifeste pas uniquement au niveau interne mais aussi externe et pour que les etats membres de l union europeenne plaident tous ensemble pour les dix huit ans une signature rapide et une action coordonnee efficace des differents pays en mati re d education et de reinsertion des enfants soldats dans le monde du travail
french sur le plan financier nous intervenons dans plusieurs pays
french notre etat de services est egalement bon en la mati re
french ce serait fantastique de pouvoir intervenir sous un seul visage et d une seule voix
french je souhaiterais donc que le commissaire verheugen nous dise quel niveau il estime nos chances de succ s en juillet
french madame la presidente j etais en ouganda en janvier dernier lorsque certaines des petites filles kidnappees et enr lees de force dans l armee par la lra ont ete liberees
french beaucoup de ces jeunes filles ont perdu le contact avec leurs familles et sont parties de leur maison depuis de nombreuses annees
french la suite de viols et d abus sexuels elles sont devenues m res leur tour ce qui les eloignent encore plus des communautes auxquelles elles ont ete arrachees aussi brutalement
french quel que soit le nombre de resolutions magnifiquement formulees que nous ayons tant que nous ne parvenons pas au sein de la communaute nous attaquer aux probl mes lies aux enfants dans notre propre communaute notre voix ne sera pas assez forte pour manifester nos inquietudes ce sujet
french nombre de nos politiques portent sur les droits et inter ts des enfants mais cette semaine le commissaire prodi a declare qu il n estimait pas necessaire de creer une unite speciale chargee des droits des enfants au sein de la communaute
french cela va affaiblir notre voix si nous essayons de l elever dans le contexte du sommet special pour les enfants de l onu l annee prochaine au cours duquel le probl me des enfants soldats occupera une place importante
french situation aux les moluques
french madame la presidente les moluques reclament une fois de plus notre attention
french apr s une periode relativement calme l arrivee recente de quelques milliers de militants du djihad qui entendent islamiser les les moluques a provoque de nouvelles escalades de violence
french la cohabitation pacifique dans laquelle chretiens et musulmans ont vecu pendant de nombreuses annees semble definitivement brisee
french je ne veux pas passer sous silence l attitude courageuse du president wahid
french la semaine derni re celui ci a m me ose critiquer la prise de position adoptee par des deputes
french si les choses dependaient uniquement du president indonesien nous pourrions esperer un avenir pacifique pour les moluques
french les forces obscures toujours presentes dans le syst me administratif tant au niveau de l armee et de la police que des autorites destabilisent toutefois fortement la situation
french le demant lement des elements fondamentalistes des groupes religieux exige encore bien des efforts
french je voudrais adresser quelques recommandations concr tes au gouvernement indonesien
french il convient d abord de lutter contre les arrivages de soldats et d armes en renfor ant les contr les frontaliers
french il faut ensuite reconsiderer la mise en x uvre de troupes d intervention internationales
french les oppositions marquees au sein de l armee et de la police semblent entraver la possibilite pour les indonesiens de mettre eux m mes un point final aux conflits
french enfin je tiens attirer l attention sur le sort des victimes des conflits c est dire les citoyens ordinaires
french nous devons non seulement nous soucier de designer les coupables dans le cadre du conflit mais surtout octroyer une aide adequate aux citoyens en fuite
french un couloir humanitaire est donc indispensable
french nous soutenons de tout c x ur l appel lance par la commission et les etats membres en vue d instaurer une aide genereuse
french l absence d inter ts politiques et economiques dans cette region ne peut aucunement determiner l ampleur de notre aide
french il s agit de soulager une detresse veritable et celle ci frappe les les moluques
french madame la presidente l histoire est elle en train de se repeter en indonesie
french les confrontations sanglantes entre chretiens et musulmans representent une menace pour la securite dans les moluques
french des milliers de gens sont tues ou contraints de fuir tandis que le tout jeune processus democratique ambitieux mais encore fort fragile mis sur pied par le gouvernement wahid est grandement menace
french les m mes evenements se sont deroules au timor oriental voici quelques mois
french en tant que depute europeen j ai pu constater sur place avec une delegation d observateurs combien les consequences d un tel conflit peuvent tre desolantes
french nous devons prendre conscience que la violence dont les moluques sont la proie menace la stabilite de toute la region
french il est d s lors essentiel que la communaute internationale fournisse immediatement une aide financi re et morale en vue de resoudre les probl mes en indonesie
french la communaute internationale a en outre le devoir de surveiller attentivement la situation et d aider le gouvernement en place mettre un terme cette veritable tragedie humaine
french madame la presidente en ma qualite de rapporteur de la commission des affaires etrang res pour l indonesie j ai effectivement hesite deposer la presente resolution parce que nous tiendrons certainement au cours de l automne une grande discussion sur la relation unissant l union europeenne et l indonesie
french cependant la situation dans les moluques est tellement grave qu elle necessite d tre traitee de toute urgence
french apr s quelques mois d accalmie les actes de violence ont nouveau embrase la region ces derni res semaines et des milliers de personnes ont repris le chemin de l exil
french le drame du bateau de refugies originaires de doema survenu halmahera a probablement co te la vie cinq cents personnes
french hier encore deux quartiers d ambon ont ete reduits en cendres par des soldats du djihad
french ce jour plus de trois mille personnes ont trouve la mort dans la region et plus de cent mille autres ont pris la fuite
french la situation est catastrophique et nombre de familles moluquoises installees aux pays bas sont plongees dans une angoisse mortelle ou dans le deuil
french madame la presidente en depit de ce drame j estime que nous devons accorder notre soutien au president wahid et au vice president soekarnopoetri
french ce ne sont pas eux mais bien les forces opposees ce gouvernement qui semblent l origine de la situation observee dans les moluques
french les milices du djihad sont apparemment financees et approvisionnees en armes par ces groupes elles beneficient en outre du soutien de forces militaires regionales qui sont en fait censees proteger la population
french nous estimons cependant que le gouvernement indonesien devrait intervenir de mani re plus vigoureuse afin de proteger les habitants des moluques
french nous pensons egalement que les observateurs internationaux les journalistes et les donneurs d aide doivent avoir acc s la region pour aider la population civile
french nous affirmons enfin que l ue doit adopter une position tr s claire ce propos tout comme les etats unis et que l ue doit intensifier l assistance aux victimes
french madame la presidente nos coll gues des verts ont depose un certain nombre d amendements qui partent sans doute d une bonne intention mais qui sont mon sens contraires l objectif poursuivi dans la mesure o ils risquent de faire le jeu des forces opposees au gouvernement actuel lesquelles alimentent les provocations dans les les moluques
french c est la raison pour laquelle je rejette l amendement relatif l article a et j invite mes coll gues des autres groupes en faire autant
french le point essentiel reside toutefois dans une intervention plus active de l union
french la resolution abonde dans ce sens et je demande la commission europeenne d y repondre favorablement
french madame la presidente chers coll gues il est de plus en plus evident que la violence qui enflamme les moluques n est pas une lutte chaotique spontanee entre la population locale entre les musulmans et les chretiens locaux
french il s agit d une lutte pour le pouvoir brutale et savamment orchestree entre des fractions de l armee entre le gouvernement et les opposants du gouvernement et ce au detriment de la population locale
french d une part on trouve le laskar djihad un groupe de musulmans fanatiques soutenus par des elements de l armee
french d autre part des troupes de police speciales qui soutiennent les chretiens
french en d autres termes le syst me de securite suppose garantir la stabilite est divise entre les deux camps
french j estime pour ma part et j esp re pouvoir rassurer ma coll gue mme maij weggen ce propos que le parlement europeen doit adresser un message au president wahid dans lequel nous affirmons notre volonte de rester critiques l egard des progr s et de la rapidite des reformes ainsi que sur la situation des droits de l homme et la mani re dont le gouvernement prot ge les citoyens des moluques
french par ailleurs ce message devrait egalement l assurer de notre soutien dans le cadre de la lutte menee contre les elements de l armee qui tentent de miner les reformes democratiques dans le combat qui l oppose des gens comme amien rais le president du congr s du peuple lequel a notamment qualifie de c x ur de la nation les jeunes gens devoues la cause du laskar djihad
french le president wahid merite notre soutien ce niveau mais nous devons garder un x il critique sur les choses qui ne vont pas encore bien en indonesie
french madame la presidente au nom du groupe socialiste je voudrais dire combien nous adherons aux paroles prononcees par mme maij weggen
french en ce moment il est essentiel de soutenir le gouvernement wahid
french ce soutien implique egalement je pense que la commission europeenne et le conseil font ainsi preuve de sagesse la recherche de moyens susceptibles d aider ce gouvernement dans ses tentatives de pacification et d intervention active
french nous lan ons par consequent un appel en ce sens
french nous jetons egalement un regard tr s critique sur ce qui se passe l bas et nous nous preoccupons aussi de la communaute moluquoise des pays bas des sentiments et des inquietudes de cette derni re
french nous insistons donc pour que le president wahid re oive notre soutien parce qu partir du moment o l on propose d envoyer des observateurs internationaux ou d autres formes d aide en dehors du president nous sapons l autorite de ce dernier
french je partage d s lors la position du ppe et je voudrais devant cette assemblee plaider avec insistance en faveur d une approche dans le cadre de laquelle nous temoignerions notre grande preoccupation notre disposition accorder notre soutien aux les moluques mais par l intermediaire de wahid nous pouvons poser des exigences mais par le truchement du president car nous devons jouer cette carte pour l instant
french madame la presidente je trouve que notre coll gue maij weggen a bien raison de qualifier la situation de catastrophique
french c est en effet une situation compliquee avec de nombreux morts qui suscite la reflexion suivante de notre part pourquoi des communautes qui vivent en relative coexistence pacifique evoluent elles subitement vers ce niveau de tension et de menaces
french je pense que derri re ces actions il y a des forces qui s activent et que la similitude entre un certain type d action aujourd hui en x uvre dans les moluques et hier au timor oriental est fort significative
french il y a en effet derri re ces mouvements des forces qui veulent saper les efforts de democratisation du president wahid nous devons les comprendre et les combattre
french de ce point de vue je crois que les references faites dans la resolution de compromis qui a ete presentee sont fort opportunes et meritent tout notre soutien
french peine de mort aux etats unis
french madame la presidente dans la resolution sur la peine de mort que nous avons presentee avec les autres groupes nous avons demande au gouverneur de l etat de virginie de sauver la vie d un condamne
french dans la liste des destinataires de notre resolution son nom a ete oublie par erreur
french je vous demande donc de faire ajouter la fin du texte de notre resolution le nom du gouverneur de virginie auquel notre petition s adresse
french oui cher coll gue vous avez tout fait raison
french dans le corps de la resolution il etait fait reference cet etat
french il convient donc sur le plan technique de la transmettre au gouverneur de virginie et elle sera donc soumise au vote avec cette modification
french madame la presidente nous pouvons tous souscrire ce qui figure dans la resolution
french nous savons que la commission des droits de l homme des nations unies a recherche un moratoire en avril de l annee derni re
french cette annee cette demande a ete reiteree
french l onu a egalement demande tous les etats qui appliquent toujours la peine de mort de reduire progressivement le nombre de crimes pour lesquels la peine de mort est appliquee
french nous possedons beaucoup de chiffres revoltants quant au nombre de personnes qui attendent toujours leur execution aux etats unis
french d apr s les informations en ma possession personnes sont concernees
french dans la resolution nous pointons du doigt l incertitude juridique qui r gne dans les cas presents
french il y a donc lieu d exiger que tous les cas soient examines ce qui signifie que l on doit revoir le cas des personnes qui attendent le prononce de leur peine et voir par exemple si elles ont eu droit un proc s equitable
french c est la raison pour laquelle un moratoire est necessaire dans l ensemble des cas m me ceux qui ne sont pas cites dans cette resolution
french c est avec espoir que nous constatons que la question de la peine de mort aux etats unis a re u un poids politique tout fait nouveau
french j apprecie egalement le travail realise par les organisations de defense des droits de l homme en vue de soulever cette question
french monsieur le president monsieur le commissaire chers coll gues mme thors l a dit il y a unanimite dans notre assemblee pour soutenir cette resolution
french nous devons nous interroger aussi sur l action de l union europeenne et sur sa capacite poursuivre au niveau des nations unies et de la communaute internationale cette initiative en faveur du moratoire international
french nous savons la difficulte due en bonne partie leur caract re baroque que rencontrent nos institutions en particulier en mati re de politique etrang re domaine place sous la responsabilite d un commissaire d un haut representant et de quinze ministres des affaires etrang res
french pour ne pas repeter l echec de l annee passee aux nations unies il est urgent que nous coordonnions l action de l union europeenne
french j ai presente en ce sens un amendement pour demander que cette politique au sein des nations unies en faveur de l institution d un moratoire universel soit coordonnee par le haut representant pour la politique etrang re et de securite commune
french j invite donc les coll gues soutenir ces amendements
french monsieur le president chers coll gues nous demandons en cette assemblee au gouverneur de l etat de virginie de sauver la vie d un condamne mort probablement innocent derek rocco barnabei
french tandis que nous discutons de notre resolution on sterilise dans une cellule du m me etat les aiguilles qui serviront l injection qui tuera dans quelques heures michael clagget coupable presume de plusieurs homicides il y a quelques annees
french je ne sais plus combien de resolutions nous avons approuvees au cours des deux derni res legislatures dans l espoir un peu vain de mettre un terme aux etats unis et ailleurs aux peines capitales
french il est certain que de nombreuses autres executions auront lieu un rythme plus soutenu d ici le mois d ao t en virginie et dans d autres etats notamment et surtout au texas dont le gouverneur presque certainement le prochain president des etats unis d amerique detient un record absolu celui d avoir mis mort tres humains au cours des cinq derni res annees
french j ignore si george w bush se vante de ce record mais je sais il me l a ecrit lui m me dans une lettre datee du mars qu il est persuade de faire appliquer en toute serenite les decisions d une justice equitable et infaillible
french dans la resolution l etude nous avons pris acte du nouveau debat en cours aux etats unis non pas sur l abolition de la peine de mort mais bien sur un moratoire qui m ne une gestion plus s re mais pas moins sans pitie
french nous avons peut tre bien fait mais je crains que toutes nos tentatives comme l a d ailleurs ecrit derni rement le quotidien americain herald tribune soient vouees rester flatus vocis lettre morte d s lors chers coll gues le moment est peut tre venu non pas de boycotter et de prendre des sanctions ce qui nous detestons faire mais par exemple de promouvoir le tourisme europeen dans la seule douzaine d etats americains qui n appliquent pas la peine de mort
french le risque de represailles est eleve tr s eleve si nous renon ons donald duck et disneyworld en floride les americains boycotteront le louvre et la joconde
french c est un risque qu il faut desormais courir dans une derni re tentative de mettre fin une pratique aussi barbare aussi infamante pour l humanite
french monsieur le president les etats unis rappelons le sont le premier pays avoir une convention des droits de l homme bien definie et justiciable et ce depuis plus longtemps que tout autre pays au monde
french c est par consequent une terrible ironie que les etats unis soient un des rares pays developpes toujours conserver et appliquer la peine de mort
french nous sommes confrontes aujourd hui un cas particulier celui de derek rockwell barnabei chaque tre humain est un individu en soi et doit tre defendu en tant que tel
french nous lan ons aujourd hui un appel pour qu il ait la vie sauve mais il represente aussi un symbole d une pratique que nous trouvons effroyable et que nous savons se derouler dans de nombreuses regions des etats unis
french je suis personnellement un grand amateur des etats unis et de nombreux aspects de son mode de vie
french je me suis souvent rendu la faculte de droit de l universite du texas et dans d autres facultes de droit des etats unis
french je les admire beaucoup mais je suis reellement triste de voir l etat et son gouverneur la pratiquer aussi souvent et s en vanter dans les campagnes presidentielles
french monsieur le president l urgence de notre resolution est motivee par le cas de derek rocco barnabei
french dans ce cas precis il y a de serieuses presomptions egalement dans l opinion publique americaine d erreur judiciaire
french il est evident que quand il s agit de la peine de mort l erreur judiciaire est particuli rement grave n oublions pas que des erreurs judiciaires ont ete verifiees dans des cas similaires et ce n est pas un hasard si elles concernaient des personnes qui n avaient pas les moyens de se payer un avocat
french je crois que les facultes de droit des etats unis fonctionnent bien parce que les avocats sont tr s bien payes mais uniquement par ceux qui peuvent se permettre de recourir leurs services
french nous demandons donc la suspension de cette sentence nous demandons que la presidence du parlement compte tenu egalement du document signe par de tr s nombreux coll gues ces jours ci ecrive directement aux autorites competentes pour attirer de fa on pressante l attention sur ce sujet et evidemment inviter abolir la peine de mort aux etats unis nous admirons ce pays pour tant d aspects
french il est donc d autant plus scandaleux de le voir conserver ce rituel barbare
french hooligans
french monsieur le president le football est une f te
french c est sous cette devise que la belgique et les pays bas ont organise l euro au cours des trois semaines ecoulees
french sur le plan sportif l evenement a aussi ete une f te sauf peut tre pour nos amis italiens
french une f te qui a cependant ete assombrie par le comportement de certains individus qui se pretendent supporters
french c est surtout avant et apr s le match allemagne angleterre que des troubles serieux ont eclate
french cent septante trois personnes ont d se rendre l h pital mille quatre cents autres ont ete arr tees et cinq cents supporters anglais ont ete rapatries bord d avions c
french certaines personnes m me au sein de cette assemblee tentent de minimiser la chose
french en ce qui me concerne monsieur le president il y a toutefois des limites aux co ts sociaux importants generes par le hooliganisme
french il est tout de m me inconcevable qu un pays doive prendre des allures d etat policier en raison d un championnat de football
french en belgique mille cinq cents gendarmes en moyenne ont ete mobilises pour chaque match et ont en outre re u le renfort de centaines de policiers locaux
french il est grand temps que les gouvernements nationaux prennent des mesures preventives afin de garder chez eux le noyau dur des hooligans
french l allemagne a donne le bon exemple en la mati re
french concr tement les soi disant supporters qui ont d ores et dej fait l objet d une arrestation en raison de leur implication dans des faits de violence lies au football doivent tre frappes d une interdiction de voyager et de sortir du pays
french la question premi re ne concerne donc pas l intensification ou la diminution des contr les aux fronti res mais bien une cooperation polici re coherente
french nous devons tirer des evenements de bruxelles et de charleroi les conclusions qui s imposent
french des mesures sev res et une bonne collaboration sont plus que jamais requises pour endiguer cette violence insensee
french le hooliganisme a franchi les fronti res au propre comme au figure
french monsieur le president on assiste trop de tragedies dans et hors des stades ces phenom nes sont le signe d un desequilibre et d un malaise social individuel d une culture de la force brutale qui n a que faire de la raison et o la violence prevaut
french la resolution du parlement reit re nos inquietudes quant l extension du phenom ne du hooliganisme et demande des mesures de prevention auxquelles je m associe
french dans cette situation il est indispensable que les forces de l ordre dans leur t che difficile ne perdent pas la t te elles aussi
french je voudrais ici m insurger contre le comportement de la police neerlandaise vis vis d une bande de journalistes italiens qui immortalisaient les difficultes rencontrees par un groupe d invalides portes bras d homme parce qu il n y avait pas assez de places leur disposition
french les journalistes ont ete emp ches d accomplir leur mission frappes jetes terre et arr tes
french nous avons vu dans l enregistrement diffuse ce matin au parlement des images qui ne laissent aucun doute sur la volonte flagrante d entraver la liberte de la presse
french les interpretations de l evenement divergent c est pourquoi nous demandons aux autorites neerlandaises de mener une enqu te pour en determiner la responsabilite et voulons que des episodes de ce genre ne se reproduisent plus jamais
french monsieur le president le titre de l ensemble n est pas hooligans mais euro et il me semble parfait
french toute l europe est parvenue organiser une gigantesque f te du foot les autorites belges et neerlandaises en t te et une masse incroyable de supporters a deferle des quatre coins du continent
french chacun eprouvait une peur extr me l idee des eventuelles violences catastrophes et autres situations delicates
french dans la pratique la f te a ete colossale et reussie la presente resolution souligne donc juste titre que nous pouvons feliciter la belgique et les pays bas
french ensuite on trouve un petit groupe de hooligans actifs depuis quelque temps dej et dont l intention non dissimulee consiste g cher ce genre de f te
french ceux ci n ont fort heureusement atteint leur but que de fa on limitee
french encore quelques remarques tout cela co te beaucoup d argent il s agit d une veritable plaie et nous soutenons donc la resolution
french l initiative des ministres belges et neerlandais de l interieur entend etudier la possibilite d appliquer une interdiction de voyage pour ce type de hooligans lorsque des evenements risques sont organises
french nous en arrivons ainsi au troisi me point l incident italien
french de toute evidence certains coll gues ont re u diverses informations propos de ce qui s est passe dans le stade de rotterdam et certains eprouvent d s lors le sentiment que les choses ont serieusement degenere ce qui a egalement influence leur jugement
french s appuyant sur d autres informations d aucuns ont l impression que la situation s est effectivement degradee mais pas au point de susciter de si lourdes accusations
french je vais vous dire ce qui est important mes yeux et je parle present en tant que neerlandais qui aurait evidemment bien voulu devenir champion d europe et qui felicite les fran ais de tout c x ur j aurais aime et cette remarque s adresse aussi aux neerlandais que lorsque certains coll gues ont l impression que les choses tournent mal cause des images diffusees nous a ne reagissions pas comme si l euro tout entier etait concerne et b que nous ne fassions pas comme si la f te etait un fiasco cause d un evenement deplorable
french il faut cependant reconna tre qu il s est passe quelque chose et nous voulons exposer les faits tels qu ils sont
french je suis donc favorable la mise en x uvre d une enqu te par les autorites neerlandaises
french celle ci a ete promise par le premier ministre kok et je fonderai mon jugement final sur ces faits
french je tiens d ores et dej exprimer toute ma sympathie et mon engagement l egard de nos coll gues italiens
french cela va de soi mais je veux neanmoins asseoir ce jugement sur des faits
french monsieur le president je voudrais commencer par manifester mon inter t puisque je suis arbitre de football en division depuis ans et que je suis tr s attache la federation anglaise de football mais aussi par feliciter la fois la france pour avoir gagne l euro d une fa on aussi fantastique et helas contre c x ur l allemagne pour avoir remporte l organisation de la coupe du monde en
french je voudrais egalement tre certain que ce parlement condamne vivement les hooligans et ce quel que soit le pays dont ils proviennent et leurs antecedents
french je prends note de ce qu a dit m van hecke propos du rapatriement de plusieurs supporters anglais dans des avions c
french il est vraiment tr s regrettable que la police belge en ait fait trop en vidant les bars des supporters de football ordinaires et decents en les emmenant avec les canailles que sont les hooligans
french la question est quel est le message qui a ete envoye par les autorites du football si l on revient quelques mois en arri re avant l euro
french un probl me a surgi lorsque deux supporters de leeds ont ete assassines lors d un match de la coupe de l uefa istanbul contre galatasaray mais aucune action n a ete prise l encontre de ce club ils n ont pas ete ejectes de la coupe de l uefa
french au danemark lorsque galatasaray a joue contre arsenal plusieurs supporters d arsenal ont ete arr tes mais n ont pas ete inculpes de hooliganisme
french ensuite nous avons l inaction du gouvernement britannique qui a choisi de ne pas imposer de sanctions supplementaires en emp chant les personnes de voyager m me s ils savaient qu ils pourraient causer des probl mes
french tous ces facteurs ont en fait conduit certaines personne penser l euro sera le dindon de la farce
french nous devrions pouvoir y assister nous allons y aller et provoquer une bonne bagarre au lieu de regarder le splendide festival du football que cela aurait d tre
french ce parlement et d autres l exterieur devraient faire marche arri re puisque nous disposons maintenant d un moment de repit que nous pouvons mettre profit pour envisager de fa on raisonnee les actions prendre avec realisme l encontre des hooligans et les comparer aux droits des personnes de circuler librement dans tout le continent
french monsieur le president je voudrais faire remarquer que cette resolution a pour titre euro et non hooligans comme le tableau l indique
french en tant que parlementaires et hommes politiques nous endossons une grande responsabilite vis vis des phenom nes sportifs en particulier ceux lies au football savoir celle de rappeler qu il ne s agit que d un jeu
french nous devons donc nous inquieter quand se greffent sur ce jeu trop d inter ts economiques ou une emotivite excessive que la politique ne peut plus aider
french je crois que nous devons rappeler nos jeunes m me aux plus acharnes ceux qui investissement le plus d un point de vue sentimental dans ces evenements que c est un jeu
french et quand le jeu est beau comme ce fut le cas lors de ces championnats d europe c est notre succ s tous
french je comprends egalement pourquoi il s agit pour les autorites qui doivent les organiser d evenements particuli rement complexes nous nous souvenons du drame du heysel
french c est pourquoi je pense que nous pouvons nous feliciter de l organisation dans ce contexte positif nous devons toutefois revenir sur l episode de rotterdam notamment parce qu il s est deroule dans des circonstances fort particuli res touchant les possibilites d acc s des personnes invalides ces evenements un acc s qui devrait tre assure dans la serenite et la bonne humeur
french nous avons en outre ete stupefait de la brutalite dont la police a fait preuve en frappant les journalistes qui rapportaient un probl me serieux quant la possibilite d acc s des personnes handicapees
french je rep te donc que pour nous il n y a pas d ordre venant d en haut il ne s agit que d un comportement inacceptable de la part des forces de l ordre
french c est pourquoi j invite tous les coll gues ne pas en faire un enjeu national parce que je pense que tout le monde peut faire sien le contenu de la resolution de compromis
french merci chers coll gues
french etant donne que plusieurs d entre vous se sont referes au titre du point l ordre du jour pour que vous ne perdiez plus de temps sur une erreur je le perdrai pour apporter quelques eclaircissements
french le point de l ordre du jour tel qu il a ete approuve par l assemblee est hooligans
french le titre de la resolution peut tre celui que vous avez mentionne effectivement mais l ordre du jour il s agit de hooligans dans le paragraphe droits de l homme
french j en profite pour preciser qu en espagnol hooligans est un anglicisme definissant des voyous specialises normalement de nationalite britannique
french monsieur le president chers coll gues la resolution de compromis que nous voterons d ici peu me semble particuli rement equilibree
french les evenements de rotterdam n entachent nullement notre jugement sur les droits de l homme ou sur la qualite des droits de l homme aux pays bas que j estime tre un des pays les plus liberaux du monde mais il reste un episode grave tant pour l attitude inqualifiable l encontre de personnes invalides que pour la violence contre des journalistes qui ne faisaient rien d autre que leur devoir
french peu importe qu ils soient italiens ou d une autre nationalite
french l union europeenne travers sa plus grande expression democratique qu est le parlement ne peut que stigmatiser un tel evenement qui s est produit en son sein
french voil ce qui me semble tre l esprit le plus juste
french tout ce qui concerne les aspects nationaux fera l objet d actions eventuelles des gouvernements et ne nous regarde pas
french d ailleurs l union europeenne avec ses resolutions d urgence n hesite pas prendre des positions rigoureuses sur certains pays ou sur certains faits enregistres n importe o dans le monde quand les droits de l homme sont violes
french quelle serait donc sa credibilite si elle ne se montrait pas capable de denoncer de tels evenements qui se produisent en son sein
french monsieur le president je serai tr s bref sur le championnat m me la france est une magnifique championne europeenne et la crainte de voir les choses degenerer massivement n est en tout cas pas devenue realite malgre un certain nombre d incidents regrettables auxquels m van hecke faisait encore reference notamment en raison des supporters anglais
french apr s la finale et toute la discussion risque present de s envenimer ce propos mais il ne peut malheureusement en tre autrement j estime qu un certain nombre de choses depassant toute limite se sont produites je pense entre autres au traitement brutal trop brutal des journalistes
french mon sens les policiers ou les stewards sous tension ont clairement outrepasse leurs competences
french toutefois bien des incertitudes entourent encore ce qui s est passe auparavant et les elements qui ont declenche les troubles
french que s est il reellement passe avec les supporters italiens handicapes
french savait on qu ils seraient aussi nombreux
french je m exprime en tant qu habitue du kuip et je sais que ce dernier poss de des places pour les supporters handicapes mais en nombre limite
french ces supporters ne voulaient ils pas tre filmes ou ne pouvaient ils pas l tre
french ce genre de question doit trouver une reponse et le gouvernement neerlandais a promis de mener une enqu te
french je me retiendrai donc d emettre tout jugement avant que les resultats soient connus
french mon groupe votera par consequent contre chaque element de la resolution o un tel jugement est exprime
french je lance un appel que j esp re convaincant nos coll gues italiens et la presse italienne en les priant et je m adresse surtout nos coll gues italiens de ne pas lancer toutes sortes de comparaisons avec le drame du heysel
french l affaire ne le merite absolument pas
french en agissant de la sorte on jette le doute sur les faits serieux qui doivent faire l objet d une enqu te
french je voudrais donc dire ceci il s est passe quelque chose une enqu te est en cours mais je vous en prie ne donnons pas des proportions demesurees cette affaire
french monsieur le president je vous remercie d avoir quand m me rappele que l intitule du point de l ordre du jour que nous examinons est le hooliganisme
french il y a deux mois j interpellais le parlement sur la necessite d agir contre les derapages que ne manqueraient pas de commettre les hooligans lors de l euro
french les mesures prises par les autorites belges ont permis d attenuer les violences clairement racistes xenophobes et homophobes des hooligans
french il devient donc imperieux de reflechir aux moyens mettre en x uvre pour neutraliser les auteurs de ces exactions souvent manipules par des mouvements d extr me droite
french il est encore trop facile aux hooligans de se deplacer en toute impunite au sein des pays de l union
french des sanctions immediates doivent tre prises dans les pays o ils se rendent coupables de delits
french ceux qui sont identifies et fiches pour avoir commis des agressions doivent tre interdits d acc s aux stades lors des grandes rencontres sportives
french les clubs de supporters et les clubs de football doivent tre davantage responsabilises parce qu il faut bien avouer que par moment ils soufflent sur la braise
french c est cette action de responsabilisation qu a menee le ministre de la jeunesse et des sports en france mme marie georges buffet et qui a fini par porter ses fruits
french je crois donc que le parlement peut jouer un r le veritable d impulsion aupr s des etats membres et aupr s de l uefa pour que de telles mesures entrent en application immediatement car le carton rouge monsieur le president doit certes s appliquer sur la pelouse mais aussi l egard des hooligans dans et hors des stades
french monsieur le president chers coll gues toutes les formes de violence doivent naturellement tre condamnees les manifestations reprehensibles de hooliganisme qui ont ponctue l euro n echappent pas la r gle
french je ne peux cependant m emp cher d tre convaincu que ces incidents bl mables ont ete demesurement amplifies tant par une partie de la presse que par une partie de la classe politique
french on n a donc selon moi pas suffisamment souligne combien l organisation de l euro etait bonne une organisation qui restera un souvenir inoubliable pour des millions de gens
french en tant que representant d un des pays organisateurs je tiens feliciter tous ceux et celles qui ont participe ladite organisation et au maintien de l ordre
french le succ s de l euro a demontre que les petits pays sont eux aussi capables de hauts faits la reussite de l euro ne peut pas tre ternie par l attitude destructrice d une minorite
french tous les etats membres doivent s entendre en vue de prendre les mesures appropriees
french l euro n etait pas seulement une f te grandiose la gloire du football c etait aussi une f te de fraternisation et de solidarite entre les citoyens de l union europeenne
french monsieur le president le groupe liberal a vote lundi contre l inscription de ce point l ordre du jour et present que j examine la resolution je pense que nous avons eu raison de le faire
french il est bien entendu charmant de distribuer des felicitations dans une resolution mais il me semble que ce n est gu re la t che de ce parlement
french le th me du hooliganisme ne peut tre qualifie d urgent car il existe depuis des annees il est certes important de l aborder au sein de ce parlement mais il ne peut tre question d urgence
french vient ensuite la question de savoir ce qui s est passe rotterdam
french une enqu te est evidemment indispensable parce que les accusations sont tr s graves
french si une equipe de television a ete enfermee toute une nuit la chose doit tre examinee serieusement et il faut qu il y ait eu de tr s bonnes raisons
french cette enqu te est en cours
french le minist re public des pays bas s y attache et il est donc absolument premature de rendre un jugement en la mati re au sein de ce parlement je pense que nous en sommes encore loin
french en ce qui me concerne il est tout fait exclu de porter un jugement politique un moment o un minist re public se penche sur l affaire
french je pense egalement que les amendements relatifs cette affaire doivent tre rejetes
french nous pouvons bien entendu revenir sur le sujet s il appara t que quelque chose s apparentant une violation des droits de l homme s est effectivement produit mais ce serait reellement trop s avancer que de rendre pareil jugement l heure actuelle
french monsieur le president je voudrais tout d abord me tourner vers notre coll gue m heaton harris qui il y a maintenant environ un mois avait cru devoir interdire la manifestation sportive charleroi il y aurait l pretendait il un terrible derapage
french lui qui a ete arbitre je dirais tr s sportivement que j avais bien fait ce moment l de le siffler
french ensuite je crois qu il faut s interesser au fond du dossier je crois effectivement que si nous pouvions avoir comme la resolution l indique une plus grande cooperation entre les differents etats membres lorsqu une manifestation telle que celle l se tient il y aurait une avancee
french si demain nous pouvions obtenir que les hooligans recidivistes ne puissent pas assister d autres epreuves et si enfin comme m fode sylla l a indique tout l heure nous avions la possibilite d avoir un suivi sur un sujet tel que celui l afin d ouvrir une autre pedagogie sur le comportement dans les stades ce serait le sport qui l emporterait et non pas l inquietude politique
french je termine monsieur le president en esperant avoir tenu un propos et un rythme de propos tel que vous l aviez demande c est dire taille humaine
french irak
french monsieur le president les nations unies ont ete emasculees par deux membres du conseil de securite sur la question des sanctions l encontre de l irak
french kofi annan est un homme bon et honorable
french il devrait pourtant demissionner etant donne que le monde est totalement oppose la severite disproportionnee de ces sanctions
french l ue doit s exprimer contre ces sanctions qui equivalent un genocide virtuel
french l objectif allegue des sanctions est de se debarrasser de saddam hussein
french il est toujours l dix ans plus tard
french en fait l objectif reel est de contr ler le petrole et de fournir un terrain d entra nement aux pilotes americains et britanniques pour qu ils puissent assurer la survie des complexes militaro industriels des etats unis et de grande bretagne
french lors de ma recente visite en irak j ai vu des enfants mourir d infections respiratoires de diarrhee de leucemie de gastro enterite et de malnutrition
french nous ne devons pas oublier que ce pays a la deuxi me plus grande reserve de petrole au monde
french les salles d operation ont des fuites d eaux d egout et un equipement depasse
french nous assistons petit petit l etranglement d une nation magnifique et d un peuple merveilleux
french je suis un ami de l islam et je pense que nous devrions arr ter au sein l union europeenne et le parlement europeen de diaboliser les arabes et l islam
french monsieur le president nous avions d abord depose un texte traitant de la m me affaire et ayant une portee identique mais ce texte est beaucoup plus nuance que celui de la resolution qualifiee de commune
french j aurais prefere discuter d un texte qui comporte davantage de nuances
french comment se fait il que ce texte ne paraissant pas nous n ayons toutefois pas retire notre signature
french nous estimons que le texte depose l origine aurait fourni une base sensiblement meilleure pour le debat
french madame maes peut tre ne nous comprenons nous pas bien mais si vous avez reitere votre signature de la resolution commune ou si vous ne l avez pas signee le texte reste en vigueur et sera soumis au vote conformement aux r gles etablies
french le texte a t il ete distribue
french est il disponible parce que je constate que nombre de coll ges n ont pas vu le texte en question
french oui bien s r
french nous ne savions pas qu il existait un probl me de distribution mais si vous le dites nous verifierons et distribuerons le texte
french monsieur le president l irak etait en guerre avec l iran de
french pendant cette periode les etats unis et l ue ont soutenu l irak parce que nous percevions l iran comme la veritable menace pour le moyen orient
french l irak a envahi le kowe t le ao t
french c etait mal et inacceptable
french l onu a repondu en adoptant la resolution qui impose des sanctions l irak
french l action de l onu etait justifiee
french les etats unis et la grande bretagne ont impose une zone d exclusion aerienne en avril
french en l irak a reconnu l integrite territoriale du kowe t
french de des inspecteurs de l onu de l unscom ont inspecte detruit et contr le la capacite de l irak produire des armes de destruction massive de fa on systematique et compl te
french le representant de l onu a rapporte l onu en que le travail de l unscom avait couvert virtuellement l ensemble de l irak
french en l agence internationale de l energie atomique a declare que l irak n avait plus de capacite nucleaire
french le programme petrole contre nourriture lance en s est avere excessivement bureaucratique et incompetent et s est traduit par d importants retards dans l approvisionnement en medicaments essentiels et en nourriture
french des milliards de dollars issus des revenus du petrole sur trois ans seuls milliards ont ete utilises pour les importations tandis que milliards sont toujours bloques dans une banque de new york
french si les sanctions avaient pour but de detruire la capacite militaire de l irak alors elles ont atteint leur objectif
french si elles visaient deloger saddam hussein elles n y sont toujours pas parvenues apr s dix ans
french les dix annees de sanctions ont toutefois engendre d enormes souffrances et une grande pauvrete parmi les millions d irakiens
french une mortalite infantile elevee la diminution de l esperance de vie une augmentation des cas de cancer et de maladies pouvant tre soignees continuent de ravager le tissu social d un pays qui a un jour connu un niveau de vie eleve
french l embargo intellectuel a prive les docteurs les enseignants et autres professionnels des progr s scientifiques et technologiques
french je pense que l union europeenne doit revoir sa position en venant en aide ceux qui souffrent d une pauvrete aigu
french l heure actuelle six etats de l ue l allemagne la france l italie l espagne le portugal et la gr ce ont une delegation diplomatique en irak
french ces diplomates partagent l opinion du bureau de l onu en irak de l oms de la croix rouge et d autres ong que l ue peut gr ce sa diplomatie parvenir une percee
french nos deputes et membres de la commission devraient aller enqu ter en irak afin de rencontrer les deputes du parlement irakien les diplomates de l ue les agences internationales et les ong
french un tel dialogue permettra d etablir les faits tels qu ils se presentent aujourd hui et d aider determiner comment sortir de cette impasse de mani re ce que les sanctions soient levees pour les fournisseurs non militaires
french j esp re que le parlement votera en faveur de cette resolution
french monsieur le president je suis convaincue de ce que tous les embargos sauf celui sur les armes sont contraires aux droits de l homme et inoperants contre les regimes autoritaires
french le voyage que j ai fait en irak a rendu encore plus inacceptable mes yeux le fait qu au nom de la defense de la democratie et des droits de la population irakienne opprimee par saddam hussein on tue un peuple et on detruise un pays
french ce qui se passe pour l instant rel ve du genocide intellectuel
french ce sont les mots du responsable du programme alimentaire mondial
french nous avons vu dans les h pitaux des enfants assistes de leurs m res qui nous regardent avec des yeux ecarquilles et nous hantent la nuit et des medecins impuissants face leur agonie
french le programme oil for food prevoit que toute marchandise importee doit passer l examen du comite des exemptions des contrats portant sur des millions de dollars sont bloques depuis des annees dans la crainte du double emploi les medicaments pi ces de rechange materiel sanitaire et autres crayons au graphite ne peuvent pas passer
french il n y a pas de vols vers bagdad et ce non en raison de resolutions de l onu mais parce que les etats unis et la grande bretagne ont impose une zone d interdiction de vol
french je voudrais que l europe passe l action et suspende unilateralement l embargo sauf celui sur les armes et reprenne les vols civils
french pour la democratie en irak redonnons confiance au peuple irakien
french rabye une jeune opposante me disait alors que les bombes tombaient sur son pays vous tes en train de tuer jusqu notre r ve de construire nous m mes notre democratie
french monsieur le president si quelqu un a besoin d un type quelconque de preuve que les sanctions permanentes contre l irak ont quelque chose de tr s mauvais il nous suffit de regarder le nombre de demissions parmi les personnes tr s influentes au sein des nations unies
french nous pouvons egalement prendre en consideration les paroles de mary robinson qui a vivement condamne la situation qu engendrent les sanctions
french le fait est que des victimes des personnes innocentes des femmes et des enfants des personnes sans aucun pouvoir sans aucun type de contr le quel qu il soit sont persecutes
french il y a une guerre silencieuse permanente contre le peuple irakien auquel peu d inter t a ete accorde et je suis content de voir que certaines personnes de ce parlement ont en fait visite l irak pour se rendre compte de la situation par eux m mes
french c est extr mement important
french le bombardement illegal par les etats unis et la grande bretagne qui n est couvert par aucune resolution du conseil de securite de l onu ne se justifie aucunement et est absolument scandaleux il ne devrait pas tre autorise continuer
french le fait que nous puissions permettre la poursuite d un bombardement illegal comme celui ci est peine croyable
french l infrastructure irakienne a ete compl tement decimee
french une fois de plus les victimes sont des personnes innocentes qui n ont aucun pouvoir
french je voudrais egalement feliciter ici certaines organisations de nos communautes qui font quelque chose ou essaient de nous sensibiliser au probl me et je voudrais mentionner ici ces voix dans le desert qui cherchent briser les sanctions je pense qu ils jouent un r le essentiel et je voudrais leur affirmer mon soutien
french nous devons egalement considerer le fait que quelles que soit les mesures prises l encontre de l irak l avenir nous devons nous concentrer sur l amelioration des droits de l homme et envisager la protection des kurdes dans le nord et des chi ites dans le sud en vue de leur garantir une certaine autonomie
french nous ne devons pas non plus les perdre de vue
french monsieur le president le avril dernier apr s un debat approfondi avec le conseil et la commission nous avons vote une resolution qui a pu tre soutenue par une majorite ecrasante de cette assemblee
french dans cette resolution nous avons appele le conseil et la commission tout entreprendre en vue d epargner la sante et la vie de la population irakienne et de mettre fin ses souffrances
french nous avons exige que l embargo soit egalement leve pour ce qui concerne les aliments et les medicaments car cet embargo ne touche pas saddam hussein mais bien la population irakienne
french nous avons exige un arr t immediat des bombardements menes par les usa et le royaume uni sans mandat du conseil de securite de l onu du fait qu ils ne touchaient et ne sanctionnaient pas eux non plus les malfaiteurs mais bien la population
french au debut de cette resolution nous avons dej confirme et souligne l obligation qu avait le gouvernement irakien d accepter et de favoriser le contr le des nations unies en ce qui concerne la destruction des armes nbc et de contribuer clarifier le sort des personnes disparues au kowe t
french le debat d aujourd hui et la proposition deposee doivent nous permettre d atteindre trois objectifs supplementaires
french premi rement nous voulons completer l appel lance au conseil et la commission par une exigence comparable l attention du conseil de securite de l onu
french deuxi mement nous voulons proposer que notre parlement prenne des initiatives et qu il entreprenne une mission d etablissement des faits sur place
french troisi mement nous voulons appuyer le fait que l onu l oms et la croix rouge veillent ce que les pauvres et les faibles d irak puissent profiter du programme en cours petrole contre nourriture
french monsieur le president tout comme m andrews je m adresse vous cet apr s midi en tant qu ami du monde arabe et islamique
french cette resolution ne peut tre soutenue que si le considerant a et le paragraphe sont consideres comme le noyau dur de cette resolution
french nous y declarons que tout assouplissement des sanctions doit dependre du respect par l irak des resolutions des nations unies
french nous devons notamment demander l irak de cooperer avec le comite international de la croix rouge sur la localisation de kowe tiens qui ont disparu la suite de l occupation illegale du kowe t par l irak
french si l ue doit se rendre en irak elle doit inclure une visite ces familles du kowe t qui attendent toujours de savoir dix ans plus tard ce qui est arrive aux tres qui leur sont chers
french une position plus faible de la part de l ue n aidera pas les irakiens mais les condamnera une tyrannie perpetuite
french monsieur le president c est bien court une minute pour un si grave sujet
french je dis grave parce qu il s agit ni plus ni moins de la survie d un peuple et de ce qu il faut bien appeler comme l a fait nagu re un ministre fran ais de la defense m chev nement une ratonnade internationale contre une nation qui pretendait echapper au nouvel ordre mondial
french cette ratonnade augure fort mal de l avenir
french ce nouvel ordre mondial expression de m bush pour masquer les inter ts des multinationales et en l occurrence des grands petroliers americains est pour nous de plus en plus intolerable
french cet egard on s etonne du silence des milieux humanitaires devant la situation des irakiens qui souffrent et pour plus d un million d entre eux dej qui meurent de notre fait
french quel contraste et quelle hypocrisie entre l humanitarisme et cet holocauste dont nous sommes tous collectivement les acteurs et cela par pure l chete face la puissance americaine ce grand empire auquel sur aucun sujet ce parlement en particulier et l europe en general ne sont capables de s opposer comme l a encore montre notre vote d hier sur echelon
french le plus grave et ce sera ma conclusion car il y aurait decidement bien trop de choses dire est que pour une fois un pays du sud parvenait se developper et que les pays du nord en rang derri re washington n ont eu de cesse de le detruire
french c est infiniment dangereux et inquietant pour le si cle qui s ouvre
french monsieur le president qui pourrait rester insensible aux malheurs de la population irakienne durement eprouvee
french je suppose donc que c etait l la motivation de ceux qui ont depose la resolution commune
french le resultat politique de leur intention est cependant une chance avortee
french pire encore il est simplement desastreux pour la partie kurde liberee de l ancien pays des deux fleuves
french je vais tre concret
french de fa on tout fait contradictoire avec ce que laissent entendre les considerants b et c saddam hussein a saborde la personnification contemporaine de nabuchodonosor dont il admire tant l ancienne civilisation
french voyez la premi re et la deuxi me guerre du golfe et ajoutez y encore cinq ans la periode pendant laquelle bagdad a categoriquement refuse de collaborer au programme d echange de petrole contre de la nourriture prolongeant ainsi inutilement les souffrances du peuple irakien
french actuellement le gouvernement irakien peut exporter du petrole sans se voir imposer de quotas s il s agit d acquerir des biens humanitaires
french bref qu est ce qui emp che saddam de soulager la mis re de ses concitoyens
french qu adviendra t il par ailleurs des reserves pour les kurdes si les sanctions sont levees de fa on inattendue
french je trouve bizarre l utilisation du terme embargo intellectuel dans le considerant d voil en effet plusieurs decennies que l intelligentsia irakienne subit l embargo intellectuel du parti baas de saddam
french en realite le tyran du tigre s interesse uniquement un certain type de scientifique le concepteur d armes de destruction de masse
french c est precisement cette obsession de saddam hussein qui demasque la na vete fort risquee du paragraphe de la resolution commune car la suppression de la zone d interdiction dans le nord de l irak c est dire la garantie internationale donnee aux kurdes contre l ennemi jure que represente saddam contraindra sans doute des millions de kurdes prendre une nouvelle fois la fuite
french ceux ci ne connaissent en effet que trop bien la valeur des promesses de saddam
french ceux qui ont depose la resolution ne peuvent viser pareil cauchemar
french voil pourquoi j ai decide de voter contre
french monsieur le president permettez moi de dire que je suis choque et horrifie par la reponse de la commission sur la question de l irak et par la fa on dedaigneuse dont elle traite ce probl me
french permettez moi juste de citer l attention du commissaire et de la commission les paroles d oscar wilde disant que dans les relations que nous entretenons avec la vie le destin ne referme jamais son livre
french l irak merite mieux que la reponse de la commission
french je suis absolument horrifie
french je voudrais exprimer mon profond mecontentement vis vis de la reponse de la commission
french c est tout
french si vous voulez tre impartial monsieur le president permettez moi d exprimer ma totale satisfaction vis vis de la reponse de la commission
french parfait il y a eu une intervention pour et une intervention contre
french nous remercions le commissaire de ne pas vouloir intervenir
french soyons brefs et poursuivons
french le debat est clos
french le vote aura lieu h
french venezuela
french l ordre du jour appelle en discussion commune les propositions de resolution suivantes
french b des deputes di pietro y sanchez garcia au nom du groupe eldr sur le venezuela
french b des deputes salafranca sanchez neyra et autres au nom du groupe ppe de sur la reconstruction et la rehabilitation des regions frappees par les inondations catastrophiques au venezuela en decembre
french b des deputes wurtz et autres au nom du groupe gue ngl sur le venezuela
french b des deputes frassoni et kn rr borr s au nom du groupe verts ale sur la reconstruction des regions sinistrees en decembre par les inondations au venezuela
french b des deputes linkohr et menendez del valle au nom du groupe pse sur la reconstruction des regions frappees en decembre par les inondations au venezuela
french monsieur le president chers coll gues nous avons aujourd hui la possibilite de montrer notre solidarite envers le peuple venezuelien qui a subi en decembre passe les affres d une catastrophe naturelle qui a frappe le littoral des etats de vargas et miranda et qui a entra ne la mort de personnes
french en consequence nous insistons sur l importance de l approbation de cette resolution qui en definitive est la consequence logique du rapport de la commission speciale qui s est rendue au venezuela pour se rendre compte sur le terrain du desastre naturel et le reflet de la coherence des engagements politiques de l union europeenne
french gr ce cela j esp re qu il sera possible de financer de mani re significative le programme de reconstruction des regions sinistrees et qu il sera elabore conformement aux schemas de ce type d action
french il conviendrait egalement de prendre en consideration des fins de coordination les programmes d aides financi res des etats membres et des regions communautaires
french monsieur le president comme vient de le rappeler m sanchez garcia cette resolution s inscrit dans le cadre de la decision prise par la conference des presidents d envoyer une mission ad hoc au venezuela pour evaluer les consequences tragiques des inondations du mois de decembre dans ce pays
french ce dossier du venezuela est grave et urgent
french grave car on calcule que les pertes n ont pas encore ete suffisamment quantifiees cette tragedie a cause la mort de plus de personnes
french urgent monsieur le president car la mission du parlement europeen a ete realisee en fevrier et jusqu present nous n avons pas ete m me de tirer des conclusions definitives
french je pense que ce parlement est dej aux limites de sa credibilite
french je profite de la presence de la commission pour demander au commissaire comment la commission a accompli le mandat que le parlement lui a confiee dans le cadre de la resolution approuvee en janvier visant evaluer la reponse communautaire la tragedie survenue au venezuela
french j esp re que la commission sera capable de mobiliser les ressources humaines necessaires pour traiter les priorites signalees par le parlement et je suis convaincu que si la commission comme elle l a propose dans son avant projet budgetaire pour peut depenser millions d euros dans les balkans elle pourra egalement depenser au moins millions d euros au venezuela
french cette affaire monsieur le president pose un probl me qui va au del de la resolution sur le venezuela
french je veux parler du maintien de la capacite de reponse du parlement ce type de situations
french monsieur le president il faut savoir tr s clairement ce que nous voulons voulons nous un veritable parlement ou un parlement en carton p te
french voulons nous un parlement assumant pleinement ses responsabilites ou un parlement voue avaliser les priorites des autres institutions
french voulons nous un parlement prenant ses responsabilites ou un parlement qui se borne signer le ch que des engagements pris par d autres institutions
french tel est le debat du budget et tel etait le debat du budget
french ce que je veux tout simplement dire monsieur le president c est qu avec de la volonte on peut toujours trouver une solution et que cette resolution suppose l engagement decide de ce parlement de manifester sa volonte d aider et de faire preuve de solidarite la solidarite de l union europeenne avec la societe et le peuple du venezuela
french je suis convaincu monsieur le president qu en nous investissant de cette volonte nous serons capables de trouver dans un budget dote de milliards d euros cette annee et qui sera similaire l annee prochaine une voie permettant de subvenir aux besoins des victimes de cette tragedie
french monsieur le president les trois points que la gauche unitaire europeenne gauche verte nordique veut soulever sur l aide que l union europeenne peut et doit accorder au venezuela la suite de la terrible catastrophe engendree par les inondations sont premi rement notre implication economique et technique dans la resolution des consequences engendrees et ne pas diminuer cette aide comme la commission en a l intention pour assumer le financement d une autre catastrophe cette fois artificielle provoquee par nous au kosovo et en yougoslavie dans les balkans
french deuxi mement la ratification et l application des conditions et decisions du sommet de kyoto afin de reduire l emission de gaz effet de serre et donc le changement climatique et ses consequences nefastes
french troisi mement la solidarite de l union europeenne envers le venezuela et envers l amerique latine en general afin de contrecarrer les effets nefastes du poids de la grande botte du nord du continent sur le reste
french monsieur le president au sujet de cette resolution qui parle de solidarite envers le peuple venezuelien je voudrais dire que nous sommes tout fait d accord avec certaines idees
french premi rement parce qu elle demande que les secours soient reellement portes aux personnes et collectivites les plus touchees
french logiquement mon groupe ne s oppose pas ce que l on parle comme c est le cas de pme et d industries en general mais il semble excessif d insister sur ces collectivites si l on ne parle pas d autres groupes qui sont davantage dans le besoin
french surtout comme l a signale m salafranca il faut que l efficacite des mesures d aide ne fasse pas les frais d un manque d effectifs humains
french deuxi mement parce qu elle denonce le refus d un point si elementaire pour notre groupe qu est l incorporation des populations touchees au moment de l elaboration et de l application des mesures d aide pour ne pas faire des choses inutiles et non desirees
french enfin last but not least il faut reflechir sur notre mani re de produire et sur notre mani re de consommer les ressources naturelles car c est ce qui l origine des catastrophes pour que nous ne devions pas les regretter de mani re recurrente
french monsieur le president la grande sensibilite de l assemblee l egard de la region latino americaine ne nous emp che pas de soutenir egalement les efforts de la commission vis vis de l europe centrale et orientale et de la reconstruction des balkans
french ce qui nous inqui te actuellement c est l abandon de cette region que nous avons commence percevoir l annee derni re avec la nouvelle commission
french c est comme si tout coup l amerique latine avait disparu de la carte des preoccupations de la commission
french en tout cas nous avons vecu une bonne experience avec la contribution que l union europeenne a apportee la region d amerique centrale apr s la catastrophe de mitch nous observons aussi une bonne reaction initiale de la commission qui s est empressee de debloquer euros pour l aide d urgence humanitaire au venezuela lorsque la catastrophe que les orateurs precedents ont mentionnee s est produite
french actuellement nous savons que la commission a la possibilite les moyens les ressources d apporter une aide plus importante
french ce type de catastrophes se produit malheureusement assez frequemment et j ai l impression que l amerique latine met bien profit les aides communautaires
french nous disposons d instruments de moyens de bonnes representations et par ailleurs d une presence europeenne dans ces zones
french il faut rappeler par exemple que l union europeenne est le principal investisseur etranger au venezuela et que nous avons tisse de nombreux liens culturels et sociaux avec ces pays
french j esp re donc que la commission envisagera avec la meilleure volonte possible les requ tes du parlement pour que les ressources disponibles et celles que l on pourrait mobiliser dans un bref delai permette de donner une reponse ces requ tes et pour que l on elabore un plan ne se limitant pas l aide humanitaire essentielle mais qui aide ce pays qui fait un grand effort se reconstruire dans son propre inter t et probablement aussi dans notre inter t car l europe est probablement le continent qui beneficie le plus du developpement de l amerique latine
french monsieur le president plus de six mois se sont dej ecoules depuis les inondations tragiques survenues au venezuela
french faisant partie de la delegation ad hoc du parlement europeen j ai eu l occasion de constater les effets terribles de ce qui est considere comme la plus grande catastrophe naturelle jamais connue en amerique latine
french il faut le voir pour le croire aussi impressionnantes que furent les photographies et les images televisees diffusees par les medias elles ne nous donnent qu une p le idee de la veritable dimension du desastre
french nous avons eu egalement l occasion de constater l action de solidarite inestimable des ong envers les populations touchees par les inondations
french cette aide humanitaire d urgence fournie par les ong n aurait pas existe sans le soutien financier de la commission je felicite donc tous ceux qui ont rendu cette aide possible
french mais la priorite doit aller present la reconstruction de toute la zone touchee ainsi qu la stimulation de la relance economique
french dans le cadre d une nouvelle planification du territoire il faut reconstruire les habitations toute sorte d infrastructures et encourager les petites et moyennes entreprises recommencer souvent de zero apr s avoir connu la destruction totale
french je suis bien conscient que la t che de la reconstruction est colossale
french c est peut tre pour cela qu elle tarde
french on a degage peine quelques routes on a regularise dans une certaine mesure la fourniture d eau et d electricite c est tout et les personnes touchees par la catastrophe se desesp rent des retards
french des milliers d entre elles dependent toujours de l aide alimentaire pour leur survie
french il faut absolument recreer les milliers d emplois qui ont ete perdus avec les pluies
french le gouvernement venezuelien a besoin de beaucoup de soutien pour promouvoir ce travail de titan
french en ce qui concerne la t che de la reconstruction qui ne peut tre remise plus tard la commission doit agir avec la m me solidarite qu elle a montre l occasion de la fourniture de l aide humanitaire d urgence ou de la m me fa on qu elle a agi envers les pays touches par l ouragan mitch
french nous demandons donc la commission un effort financier significatif dans les cinq prochaines annees
french en plus d un devoir elementaire de solidarite les liens historiques qui nous lient au venezuela et la stabilite de la democratie dans ce pays l exigent
french je voudrais tout d abord souligner que contrairement aux soup ons exprimes en ce lieu la commission reconna t tout fait l importance politique de l amerique latine et a pris ces derniers temps une serie d initiatives qui soulignent l importance politique tout particuli re de l amerique latine pour l europe
french deuxi mement je voudrais faire remarquer qu en ce qui concerne la catastrophe du venezuela il vaut la peine de reflechir ses causes et ses consequences ainsi qu aux responsabilites qui s y rapportent
french d s le depart l union a apporte une aide importante et continuera sur cette voie l avenir
french cette aide porte sur deux choses
french il s agit tout d abord de l aide la reconstruction dans l etat federe de vargas
french on peut d s present y voir un peu plus clair sur les besoins existants ce n etait pas le cas au debut
french je comprends les manifestations d impatience ce sujet car certaines choses vont tr s lentement
french toutefois aucune proposition de projet ne nous a ete soumise par le gouvernement venezuelien
french je ne dis pas cela sur un ton critique
french il est vraisemblablement difficile pour le gouvernement venezuelien de decider rapidement quelles sont les priorites etablir
french c est la raison pour laquelle nous avons envoye une commission d experts au venezuela afin de constater par nous m mes quelles sont ces priorites
french le resultat vous est presente aujourd hui
french dans quelques jours une communication s y rapportant sera adressee au conseil sur les mesures soutenir et les fonds necessaires
french le deuxi me element bien plus important mes yeux que l aide la reconstruction est l aide pour la prevention des catastrophes
french nous voulons en effet faire en sorte que des programmes qui traitent de la gestion des risques naturels dans les etats federes de falcon miranda et de jarakui soient etablis et deposes
french la prevention des catastrophes c est la le on que nous avons d tirer de la catastrophe du venezuela est tout particuli rement susceptible d ameliorations
french je pense que nous aiderons d autant mieux les gens dans le long terme si nous nous concentrons sur ce point
french en ce qui concerne le financement de ces deux mesures nous sommes face une question tr s difficile car c est dej un probl me pour la commission de s entendre constamment chapitrer par le conseil et le parlement sur ce qu elle doit faire et qui elle doit aider sans que personne ne lui precise malheureusement o elle doit prendre l argent pour toutes ces missions
french comme vous le savez nous ne pouvons pas l imprimer nous m mes
french nous trouverons un moyen de financer ces projets nous ferons des propositions realistes ce sujet des propositions qui tiendront d ailleurs compte des ressources recoltees par ce pays la suite de l augmentation sensible de ses recettes gr ce l exportation de petrole
french merci beaucoup monsieur le commissaire
french la discussion commune est close
french le vote aura lieu h
french observatoire europeen contre le racisme et la xenophobie
french l ordre du jour appelle en discussion commune les propositions de resolution suivantes
french b de m van velzen au nom du groupe ppe de sur la polemique sur l observatoire europeen du racisme et de la xenophobie
french b des deputes wurtz et autres au nom du groupe gue ngl sur la demission de m pelinka representant autrichien au conseil d administration de l observatoire europeen du racisme et de la xenophobie
french b des deputes m ford et autres au nom du groupe pse sur la demission de m pelinka representant autrichien au conseil d administration de l observatoire europeen du racisme et de la xenophobie
french monsieur le president je partage l opinion de m watson le president de la commission des libertes et des droits des citoyens de la justice et des affaires interieures qui a dit lors d une interview que la motion d urgence proposee par m swoboda n etait pas la bonne demarche et qu il s attendait une mani re de proceder un peu plus m re
french je partage cette opinion car pour justifier la motion qu il a presentee devant cette assemblee m swoboda fait reference de vieux conflits entre le gouvernement autrichien et la directrice de l observatoire europeen contre le racisme et la xenophobie
french il s agit de l epoque o viktor klima un membre du sp etait la t te du gouvernement et que le gouvernement etait domine par le sp
french lorsqu un socialiste autrichien fait pareille chose c est scabreux mais en rien urgent
french je soutiens d s lors ce que m watson a dit car m swoboda confirme egalement que le gouvernement actuel entretient nouveau de meilleurs rapports avec l observatoire europeen contre le racisme et la xenophobie
french il devrait s en rejouir comme moi et d autre personnes le faisons
french il n y a donc pas mati re un debat d urgence encore moins si je cite ce qu a dit la directrice de l observatoire europeen contre le racisme dans une interview qu elle a autorisee
french elle loue la nouvelle politique de l autriche l egard des etrangers et conc de que le gouvernement n a pas entrepris une seule initiative caract re xenophobe mais qu il a au contraire realise de nombreux progr s
french elle ajoute que ces nombreux progr s n etaient pas possibles sous l ancien gouvernement rouge noir et precise bien entendu que son travail n a en aucun cas ete entrave
french alors que signifie tout cela monsieur swoboda
french en tant que socialiste autrichien vous semblez uniquement vouloir constituer une plate forme en vue de polemiquer ici contre l autriche
french c est un acte honteux de la part d un autrichien et il convient de le condamner sev rement
french monsieur le president je suis desole pour les traducteurs si j ai parle trop rapidement tout l heure
french je voudrais vous parler de la demission de m pelinka du conseil d administration de l observatoire de vienne
french je crois que ce qui est arrive m pelinka universitaire de renom respecte par la communaute scientifique est revelateur de la vraie nature de la coalition au pouvoir en autriche
french l extr me droite surtout lorsqu elle est au pouvoir est experte dans l art de pousser bout les opposants
french et ce qui s est passe dans le cas de m pelinka n est ni une co ncidence ni un hasard
french on a d abord commence par le calomnier on l a persecute par l intermediaire d un jugement inique rendu par une justice aux ordres du fp puisque l actuel ministre de la justice du fp etait l avocat de j rg haider quand celui ci a poursuivi m pelinka pour diffamation
french ensuite on a rendu le travail de l observatoire infernal par une campagne publique de pression contre ses membres
french je crois que haider exprime et il faut le reconna tre son mepris vis vis des sanctions que l union europeenne lui impose actuellement car au moment o la presidence portugaise prend l initiative de proposer la nomination de trois sages c est ce moment l qu il prend la decision de repliquer en exigeant un referendum sur la levee des sanctions referendum compl tement demagogique populiste et antieuropeen
french il s agit egalement d un defi que j rg haider lance l ensemble de la communaute
french il nous rappelle que l observatoire est une creation de l union europeenne et que notre presidente etait son inauguration il y a trois mois
french c est la preuve pour ceux qui en douteraient encore qu il ne faut pas negocier avec l extr me droite car chaque petite victoire qu elle obtient la renforce et la banalise
french ce n est pas parce que l union europeenne adoucirait sa position sur l autriche que haider et ses amis se mettraient miraculeusement defendre les droits de l homme et renier leur ideologie
french en reponse nous devons apporter notre total soutien m pelinka nous devons egalement aider l observatoire sur les plans humain politique et financier et enfin les etats membres doivent continuer isoler le gouvernement autrichien et tout en apportant notre soutien au peuple autrichien isoler la coalition qui est inacceptable et inique
french monsieur le president j ai eu l honneur de representer le parlement europeen au sein du comite directeur de l observatoire europeen des phenom nes racistes et xenophobes et l un des mes coll gues etait le professeur anton pelinka qui representait le gouvernement autrichien
french il a joue un r le important dans nos deliberations en conseillant la moderation quand d autres voulaient aller trop loin et trop vite en resistant aux stereotypes faciles et bon marche l encontre de ceux faisant l objet de nos enqu tes et en imposant des faits plut t que l imagination
french l un dans l autre il s est avere un compagnons frustrant pour ceux d entre nous qui voulaient aller plus loin et plus vite
french j ai d s lors ete choque de decouvrir qu une victimisation d etat s est developpee contre le professeur pelinka tout d abord par l avocat de haider agissant comme juge et partie dans le proc s pour diffamation l encontre de m haider que le professeur pelinka a decrit comme celui qui etait responsable d avoir rendu les positions et declarations des nationaux socialistes politiquement acceptables
french et deuxi mement j ai ete choque lorsqu il a ete demis de force de son poste de vice president du comite directeur de l observatoire europeen au travers de tracasseries administratives de la part de sections du gouvernement autrichien actuel
french cette resolution charge notre commission des libertes publiques comme l a demande m watson lundi de suivre ces developpements de pr s
french peut tre ne devrions nous pas tre surpris par ce qui est arrive
french m haider a dit en du professeur pelinka apr s que ce dernier a souligne le passe nazi de hans steinecker un precurseur du parti de la liberte c en est fini des falsificateurs de l histoire et de ceux qui insultent l autriche
french m pelinka a une relation perturbee avec la carinthie et sa fa on de propager en permanence des mensonges est inacceptable
french en mars de cette annee le parti de la liberte a declare les journaux avaient une fois de plus raison
french maintenant il haider nous menace
french mais il ne menace personne
french c est relativement normal
french si je nourris un chien et qu il me mord je ne le nourris plus de peur qu il ne me morde de nouveau
french les sages ont une lourde t che devant eux au cours des six mois venir
french monsieur le president je ne voudrais pas m engager dans une polemique facile en particulier celle de mon coll gue pirker mais plut t tenir une discussion d un certain niveau et m en tenir aux faits
french le fait est que l observatoire contre le racisme et la xenophobie a bel et bien connu au cours des premi res semaines des difficultes qui etaient politiquement motivees et que mon coll gue pirker a insulte de la mani re la plus grossi re la directrice de l observatoire qu il prend aujourd hui temoin pour demontrer comme les choses vont bien
french le fait est et c est une chose laquelle je me suis egalement tenu lors de ma premi re intervention les sieurs parlementaires qui tiennent de si grands discours n etaient pas l lundi que les choses se sont ameliorees etant donne que mme winkler la directrice de l observatoire et le nouveau representant du gouvernement autrichien se sont efforces de redonner la situation une dimension plus raisonnable
french le fait est egalement que la situation reste precaire et l instar de mme winkler j affirme qu il n y a malheureusement pas que le gouvernement autrichien qui n accorde pas une aide suffisante l observatoire mais que d autres gouvernements sont egalement concernes
french il est donc urgent que tous les gouvernements comme je l ai propose soient contraints de soutenir l observatoire
french mais le fait est aussi que malheureusement le referendum annonce en autriche contre lequel se sont exprimes il y a quelques jours des representants du parti populaire europeen mais surtout du parti populaire autrichien qui si gent dans cette assemblee pourrait bien une nouvelle fois aggraver de mani re dangereuse la situation et le climat que conna t l autriche car il a eveille des sentiments anti europeens qui ne facilitent certainement pas la t che de l observatoire contre le racisme et la xenophobie
french je voudrais d s lors exprimer mon opinion et demande au gouvernement et ses representants de renoncer ce referendum afin de ne pas attiser une nouvelle haine un nouveau climat anti europeen qui ne peut vrai dire que deplaire au parti populaire autrichien lequel a toujours ete un parti pro europeen
french je m oppose resolument une telle atmosph re et j esp re qu il en va de m me pour cette assemblee
french monsieur le president je vous dirai immediatement que le groupe eldr a refuse de signer la resolution commune pour une raison tr s simple nous la trouvons un peu trop passionnee elle n a pas la rigueur necessaire et n offre pas la possibilite d un choix plus politique et plus equilibre au nom du parlement
french c est parce que cette resolution est trop faible que nous ne la voterons pas
french nous estimons que le probl me lie la demission de m pelinka est suffisamment important pour ne pas tre aborde par une resolution qui fait place la passion mais ne veut rien dire et est tr s edulcoree
french permettez moi une remarque l intention du groupe gue et du groupe pse
french je ne comprends pas leur accord sur le texte tel qu il est depose par rapport au texte initial qu ils avaient eux m mes introduit
french d s lors nous souhaitons au sein du groupe liberal et c est le souhait de m watson que sa commission puisse se saisir effectivement du dossier et que nous sachions de mani re extr mement claire si le gouvernement autrichien a enfreint l article du traite c est dire qu il n a pas rempli ses obligations l egard de l observatoire
french s il n a pas rempli ses obligations il appartient au parlement d agir en consequence vis vis de la commission et vis vis du conseil
french le tout est de le savoir et aujourd hui nous ne le savons pas
french monsieur le president mon groupe soutient egalement la proposition du president de la commission des libertes et des droits des citoyens de la justice et des affaires interieures visant traiter minutieusement toute cette affaire au sein de cette commission
french nous approuvons neanmoins cette resolution car elle represente contrairement aux premiers projets une reaction extr mement moderee et responsable aux propos de la directrice de l observatoire devant la commission des affaires interieures
french cette decision a egalement ete debattue et decidee conjointement avec le ppe
french l incapacite des deputes du parti populaire autrichien d approuver cette decision qui ne constitue qu une premi re preoccupation et une premi re requ te au gouvernement autrichien m etonne donc particuli rement ils nous donnent un avant go t de la fa on d agir du gouvernement federal autrichien avec les critiques gouvernementaux
french m pirker donne ici lecture des declarations de la directrice de l observatoire et tait les propos bouleversants qu elle a tenu en commission o elle a ete tr s vertement attaquee par ledit m pirker sur les diffamations de l observatoire au sein du parlement autrichien les declarations sur les chicanes systematiques sur l absence de r glements de securite sur le manque de soutien
french je deplore que les deputes de l vp nous laissent ici egalement entrevoir comment ils traitent les critiques gouvernementaux dans leur propre pays o l on essaie precisement de les presenter comme des tra tres leur pays
french lorsque l on a entendu les declarations de m pirker qui s adressent ceux qui critiquent l autriche on se rend compte qu il s agit veritablement d une tentative affreuse visant generer un conflit entre la defense des droits de l homme et le patriotisme
french ce sont l de scandaleuses convictions
french monsieur le president chers coll gues nous debattons d une proposition de resolution qui manque de substance
french nous ne savons pas o se situent precisement les elements de protestation c est dire que nous discutons d un sujet que nous ne connaissons pas exactement
french qui a reellement pris connaissance de la lettre de demission de m pelinka
french qui conna t les veritables circonstances de sa demission
french ce que l on sait en autriche propos de la demission de m pelinka c est que diverses versions circulent ce sujet de differents c tes
french ce que je sais c est qu une procedure judiciaire est en cours entre m pelinka et m haider ce n est en aucun cas la politique ni un quelconque parlement de critiquer de surcro t une procedure en cours devant une juridiction independante
french dans chaque etat de droit il existe des moyens juridiques constitutionnellement prevus
french une politique qui ne respecte pas l independance de la justice ne respecte finalement pas le principe de la separation des pouvoirs et enfreint de la sorte un principe fondamental essentiel de la democratie
french le racisme et la xenophobie constituent un probl me tr s grave et prendre au serieux au sein de toute l union
french partout o il se presente il doit tre combattu par tous les moyens
french ce que j attends de la part de l observatoire c est un inventaire objectif et une reflexion comparative qui permettront la politique de reagir
french ce que je n attends pas de l observatoire c est une immixtion dans des questions de politique courante et l exercice de ce mandat avec des lunettes ideologiques
french car derri re les notions de racisme et de xenophobie se trouvent des gens et leur sort qui ne doivent pas servir un show politique
french ce que je rejette c est le fait que cette proposition de resolution non differenciee emane de deputes autrichiens qui s engagent soi disant pour ma patrie
french monsieur le president la commission remercie le professeur pelinka pour la precieuse contribution qu il a apportee dans son r le de membre du conseil d administration pour la fondation de l observatoire europeen contre le racisme et la xenophobie
french c est toutefois une pratique constante de la commission de ne pas prendre position concernant des actions en justice impliquant des individus dans les etats membres
french cela vaut particuli rement pour le cas present exterieur au domaine d application du droit europeen
french de plus la commission ne peut pas s exprimer sur les motifs ayant conduit la demission du professeur pelinka du conseil d administration de l observatoire
french les services de la commission ont dej prie les autorites autrichiennes de designer un nouveau membre au sein du conseil d administration
french la commission souligne l importance de l independance des membres du conseil d administration telle que celle ci est stipulee dans le r glement portant creation de l observatoire
french je ne pense devoir ici certifier car tout le monde le sait que la commission a jusqu present toujours soutenu de toutes ses forces l observatoire de vienne et qu elle continuera le faire l avenir
french nous sommes intimement persuades que l observatoire joue un r le important dans la lutte contre le racisme la xenophobie et l antisemitisme
french je voudrais souligner encore une fois clairement que la commission attache la plus grande importance preserver en toutes circonstances l independance et l autonomie maximale de l observatoire dans l accomplissement de ses t ches
french le debat sur les probl mes d actualite urgents et d importance majeure est clos
french nous passons maintenant au vote
french avant le vote sur les enfants soldats en ouganda
french monsieur le president nous avons elabore une proposition de resolution commune laquelle cinq groupes ont travaille
french apr s que le document a ete prepare un sixi me groupe s est rallie cette proposition
french j estime qu il est contraire notre r glement qu un groupe adh re cette proposition sans demander l avis des autres
french mon groupe consid re cela comme une infraction notre r glement et je vous prie monsieur le president d examiner cette affaire
french etant donne que nous avons collabore cette proposition de resolution nous voterons de toute fa on en sa faveur et nous vous demandons de veiller ce que le sixi me groupe soit raye de cette proposition
french nous y avons jete un coup d x il et pour autant que nous sachions il n existe pas de r glement interdisant quelqu un de signer une autre resolution
french la signature peut donc tre apposee
french mais je voudrais suggerer que ce point soit etudie dans le futur
french avant le vote sur le venezuela
french monsieur le president il s agit ici du m me cas que celui que j ai decrit en commen ant
french je tiens ce que vous fassiez examiner cette affaire car durant cette semaine de session un de nos coll gues a voulu se rallier une proposition de resolution d autres groupes et a d fournir l accord ecrit des autres groupes
french nous ne pouvons pas appliquer deux procedures differentes au cours de la m me semaine
french je voudrais par consequent vous demander d examiner l affaire et de nous faire savoir quelle sera l issue de cet examen
french cela mis part nous soutiendrons cette proposition car nous y avons travaille
french je comprends parfaitement ce que vous dites
french nous etudierons le probl me mais il ne semble pas qu il existe de r glement l heure actuelle
french monsieur le president comme vous le dites m sakellariou au debut de la periode de session nous a gratifies de quatre demandes de modification de l ordre du jour qui ont toutes ete rejetees et maintenant il veut terminer sa periode de session avec une autre demande qui est comme vous l avez dej dit absolument irrecevable
french on peut continuer ainsi mais on va perdre du temps
french le president a dej repondu
french il me semble qu il a tout fait raison
french je ne veux pas de debat supplementaire
french nous etudierons ce probl me
french votes
french monsieur le president je voudrais seulement intervenir pour manifester l enorme tristesse avec laquelle nous venons d apprendre la nouvelle d un terrible accident survenu sur les routes espagnoles entre un camion et un autocar rempli d ecoliers catalans dont le un bilan provisoire s el ve morts et blesses dont plusieurs dans un etat grave
french onsieur le president c est une motion de procedure
french la suite aux debats du conseil hier soir je me demandais si ce rapport etait en fait assez proche de la proposition originale pour permettre la procedure de premi re lecture
french il y a de nombreux amendements pour lesquels nous avons besoin de plus de clarification
french si nous nous pronon ons en leur faveur cela n eloignerait il pas davantage ce rapport de ce que cette assemblee a le droit de voter
french ma remarque concerne les amendements et dont certains impliquent directement le programme jusque dans les ecoles des etats membres
french j aimerais savoir si cette procedure est legale et nous permet de voter maintenant
french tous les amendements ont ete verifies et approuves par les services nous allons donc proceder au vote

french p e president
french heure des votes est close
french monsieur le president j interviens seulement pour preciser l information que j ai transmise cette assemblee il y a un instant
french effectivement l accident survenu en espagne est tr s grave
french le nombre d enfants decedes s el ve et leurs familles auxquelles nous voulons transmettre nos condoleances sont originaires cerdanyola del valles et de viladecans dans la province de barcelone
french je m assurerai que le president en soit d ment informe et qu il en soit ainsi
french monsieur le president je ne connais pas la gravite des evenements mais s il y a des enfants qui sont morts je proposerais peut tre l assemblee que nous observions une minute de silence
french nous devons disposer de plus d informations sur l ampleur de cette tragedie
french explications de vote rapport redondo jimenez a
french monsieur le president j ai vote en faveur du rapport redondo qui reglemente l intervention de l union europeenne en cas d incendies et de pollution atmospherique
french c est certainement une disposition positive
french j ai vote favorablement mais je voudrais qu l avenir on tienne compte dans l application de cette proposition de ce que de nombreuses personnes gees et retraitees vivent pr s des for ts et que ces personnes sont souvent les derni res tre restees dans les campagnes et regions isolees frequemment frappees par les incendies
french il serait donc bon voire opportun d utiliser ces personnes dans la lutte contre les incendies
french ce rapport prevoit des amendements aux r glements actuels sur la protection des for ts de la communaute contre la pollution atmospherique et contre les incendies
french les amendements concernant le r glement sur la lutte contre les incendies de for t sont particuli rement importants pour le portugal
french en effet il faut accorder toujours plus d attention la for t mediterraneenne fort touchee par les incendies ce qui exige donc la mise disposition de moyens financiers eleves pour proceder au repeuplement et aux necessaires mesures de prevention contre les incendies
french pour le portugal o les incendies ont detruit d importantes zones foresti res il est fondamental d augmenter les budgets afin de completer les investissements nationaux en incluant la construction d infrastructures et l acquisition d equipements pour les activites developper dans la prevention des incendies tant par les autorites que par les associations de proprietaires prives ou les organes de gestion des terrains en friche
french d o l importance majeure du renforcement des montants communautaires que la rapporteur propose de fixer millions d euros au lieu des millions de la proposition de la commission
french il importe egalement de creer un syst me communautaire d information sur les incendies de for t permettant une meilleure connaissance de la situation actuelle de mani re rendre possible une lutte plus efficace contre les incendies de for t et leurs causes
french je m exprimerai en mon nom personnel sur le rapport concernant les for ts
french je sais que la commission de l agriculture nous dit que nous nous trompons de debat en defendant une augmentation du budget dans le cadre de ces rapports
french pour ma part j estime que nous avons la responsabilite politique d envoyer des signaux politiques forts la commission au conseil et aux citoyens
french en decembre une partie de l union a ete sinistree par de terribles temp tes qui ont devaste une grande partie des for ts du sud et de l est de la france et suscite le desespoir des sinistres en particulier chez les petits proprietaires
french je sais aussi que l on n habille pas pierre en deshabillant paul
french en votant pour les propositions du rapporteur j ai souhaite contribuer la mise en place d une veritable politique foresti re de l union car malgre le budget colossal de la pac la for t qui fait partie integrante de l agriculture reste la grande oubliee
french el l importance des for ts pour le maintien des equilibres ecologiques fondamentaux de l ecosyst me de la vie m me est enorme
french malheureusement la protection et l attention qu on leur accorde ne sont pas proportionnees cette importance
french les enormes desastres subis par les for ts au cours des derni res annees ainsi que la faiblesse des reactions pour y faire face mettent gravement en danger tant l equilibre ecologique que la sante la securite et nombre de valeurs culturelles sociales indissociablement liees au patrimoine forestier
french ces derni res annees les massifs forestiers notamment ceux du bassin mediterraneen ont gravement ete touches par le deboisement les incendies la desertification l abandon l exploitation abusive l insuffisant reboisement ce qui a abouti la perte de dizaines de milliers d hectares precieux de superficies boisees
french je vous exposerai le dramatique probl me de la gr ce qui est le premier pays dans toute l europe en termes de superficie br lee par incendie
french en gr ce seules des zones incendiees sont reboisees
french pour ce qui est des restants ils sont livres soit l abandon soit pour leur plus grande part la violation et la construction illicite au service d inter ts economiques par exemple des entreprises touristiques qui sont selon la r gle toujours du c te du gouvernement au pouvoir qui tirent avantage des incendies ou peut tre en sont responsables de l insoluble probl me de la propriete de l absence de cadastre forestier et d inventaire du patrimoine forestier de l etat en vue d accro tre leur profit
french il est un fait qu il existe une grande variete des for ts communautaires septentrionales temperees mediterraneennes et tropicales et en regard une grande variete de probl mes et de particularites
french il n a pas suffit que la strategie foresti re menee par l ue jusqu aujourd hui n ait pas reussi faire face ces probl mes en raison de ses politiques fragmentaires conjoncturelles inconsequentes et inconstantes ainsi que des fonds insuffisants dont elle disposait voil qu present la commission propose de reduire encore les fonds dej minimes destines la protection des for ts contre les incendies et la pollution atmospherique
french la raison invoquee pour justifier ces reductions proposees est l absorption insuffisante des fonds au cours des derni res annees
french les probl mes cependant n ont pas ete resolus
french au contraire ils se sont aggraves
french une telle politique n est pas seulement hypocrite
french elle est complice et incendiaire
french pour notre part nous perseverons
french nous appelons aussi le parlement europeen se souvenir de ses resolutions reiterees et de ses prises de position en faveur de mesures renforcees de prevention et de lutte contre les incendies de protection et de mise en valeur du patrimoine forestier dans toutes les regions de l union
french nous estimons que les ressources financi res communautaires qui ont ete affectees la sauvegarde des for ts etaient et demeurent tout fait insuffisantes et nous demandons leur augmentation pour qu elles soient la hauteur des besoins reels et de l importance des for ts
french il est indispensable en collaboration avec les autorites nationales et locales avec les organes competents que des initiatives adequates soient prises pour definir une politique foresti re efficace et le developpement d une action immediate et coordonnee lesquelles permettront la renaissance et le reboisement des zones foresti res devastees dans le respect des conditions bioclimatiques et ecologiques de chaque region et sur la base des donnees et methodes scientifiques actuelles il s impose nous le repetons que l union europeenne et les gouvernements fournissent les fonds indispensables la creation des infrastructures necessaires et l embauche d un personnel qui si nous en jugeons par la gr ce est totalement insuffisant
french c est ainsi que nous contribuerons la protection au developpement la preservation ecologique et la mise en valeur productive des for ts de ces pays
french monsieur le president je me suis abstenu lors du vote sur le rapport arvidsson sur l interdiction de l utilisation des phtalates
french je me suis abstenu comme tout le groupe du parti populaire europeen mais mon comportement refl te un doute plus profond parce que peu avant de venir voter je me suis pose la question suivante vu que nous n interdisons pas l utilisation d une substance les phtalates partout mais seulement dans la fabrication de jouets pour enfants qu arrivera t il aux entreprises qui produisent les phtalates
french ces phtalates ne seront ils pas utilises d autres fins
french peut tre pour des objets qui peuvent tre destines aux personnes gees et aux retraites
french ou peut tre quelqu un d autre
french cela m inquieterait beaucoup
french je ne poursuivrai pas monsieur le president parce que nous ne siegeons pas huis clos et je pref re donc m arr ter ici
french sv l explication de vote suivante presentee par le groupe ppe de du parlement s applique dans le cas o l amendement de l article de la directive est adopte
french les deputes du groupe ppe de choisissent de s abstenir lors du vote sur la resolution legislative puisque l amendement de l article de la directive a ete adopte
french motif l etiquetage et la presence d un avertissement sur les jouets et articles de puericulture destines des enfants de ans enti rement ou partiellement fabriques en pvc souple contenant des phtalates ainsi que sur leur emballage est tr s difficile et risque en realite de devenir une interdiction etendue indirecte
french la portee de la decision sur l etiquetage outrepasse donc la base scientifique de la directive
french le dossier de la securite des jouets me tient particuli rement c x ur
french je fus rapporteur sur ce th me en et je suis avec la plus grande attention les evolutions legislatives en cette mati re
french en ce qui concerne les phtalates ces substances chimiques destinees assouplir le pvc j ai toujours milite en faveur de mesures volontaristes en vue de proteger comme il se doit ce groupe de consommateurs particuli rement vulnerables que constituent les enfants
french des experiences sur les animaux ont demontre la toxicite et le caract re cancerig ne de certains phtalates ces substances peuvent en effet provoquer des affections hepatiques renales et testiculaires chez les enfants qui sucent ou mordillent des tetines hochets ou anneaux de dentition
french cette enumeration de risques a suscite l inquietude legitime des parents ce qui aurait d conduire l adoption de mesures fermes repondant aux exigences du principe de precaution
french or le moins que l on puisse dire est que la reaction de la commission si elle fut relativement rapide demande d avis au comite scientifique etudes de toxicite d ecotoxicite et d effet sur l environnement decision d interdiction d urgence et proposition de modification des directives concernees fut bien frileuse au regard des enjeux et au regard des objectifs de garantie d un niveau eleve de protection des consommateurs et de protection de la sante humaine
french que nous a propose la commission europeenne
french elle a propose d interdire les jouets contenant un des phtalates incrimines destines tre mis en bouche par les enfants de moins de trois ans d apposer un avertissement sur les jouets contenant un des phtalates incrimines susceptibles d tre mis en bouche par les enfants de moins de trois ans et de reviser la directive d ici quatre ans
french c est bien entendu totalement insuffisant
french il est ridicule de ne prevoir une interdiction que pour les jouets ou objets de puericulture destines tre portes la bouche
french en effet tous les parents le savent les enfants en bas ge portent tout la bouche
french il faut donc interdire les jouets et objets qui sont susceptibles d tre mis en bouche totalement ou partiellement et qui contiennent des phtalates
french en effet le manque d informations scientifiques fiables sur la migration de ces substances chimiques dans l organisme doit nous conduire mettre en x uvre le principe de precaution
french je tiens egalement souligner qu il faudra nous montrer particuli rement vigilants l egard des substances qui seront utilisees pour remplacer les phtalates
french par ailleurs il est indispensable de generaliser l etiquetage des jouets et objets de puericulture contenant des phtalates susceptibles d tre mis en bouche
french pour eviter d inciter les enfants mordiller ou sucer leurs jouets une disposition devra tre ajoutee prevoyant d interdire l ajout de substances aromatiques
french il faut prevoir de reviser la directive de fa on l actualiser en fonction des progr s des connaissances scientifiques
french je suis convaincu que dans l etat actuel de nos informations nous devons faire preuve de la plus grand prudence
french j ai soutenu les amendements deposes par les membres socialistes de la commission de l environnement
french je terminerai en rappelant qu en ce qui concerne le dossier de la securite des jouets les r gles en mati re de marquage ce sont trop ambigu s et devraient rapidement faire l objet d une clarification
french la nocivite des phtalates pour la sante humaine n a pas pu tre etablie scientifiquement
french par exemple selon la recherche effectuee aux etats unis par l u s consumer product safety commission tr s peu d enfants s il y en a peuvent tre soumis au risque de se sensibiliser aux substances chimiques dangereuses car les quantites de phtalates contenues dans les jouets n atteignent pas un niveau qui pourrait tre dangereux
french puisque les quantites de phtalates qui pourraient eventuellement passer des jouets l organisme d un enfant sont si minimes le groupe d etude ne recommande pas l interdiction des phtalates
french moi m me je ne suis pas favorable l exc s de precautions ni une interdiction trop rigoureuse qui n est pas scientifiquement fondee
french les effets toxiques brusques des phtalates sont minimes et ils ne provoquent pas d irritations des muqueuses ou de la peau
french bien qu on ait constate dans les annees que de tr s grandes quantites de phtalates causaient des tumeurs de foie aux rats et aux souris les milieux officiels en europe et aux etats unis n ont pas confirme le caract re cancerig ne des phtalates sur les tres humains
french en outre je n aime pas l idee de remplacer les phtalates par des substances pour lesquelles nous ne disposons d aucune etude scientifique
french je suis neanmoins favorable aux etudes supplementaires sur les phtalates dont les effets ne sont pas confirmes
french en pratique le probl me est reduit en europe car l industrie europeenne des jouets a dans une large mesure dej renonce aux phtalates
french rapport hieronymi a
french monsieur le president j ai vote en faveur du rapport media mais je crois que puisque ce sont les a nes et les retraites qui regardent le plus la television et qui sont donc les premiers concernes par les aides communautaires il serait bon qu ils puissent voir une television europeenne des programmes europeens diffuses sur une television europeenne
french je crois que l on parviendrait ainsi mieux preserver la culture de nos nations qu en important uniquement des series et films tournes dans d autres pays essentiellement aux etats unis
french je souhaite donc que l on tienne compte de ma proposition lors de la mise en x uvre de ce document
french monsieur le president je voudrais que vous priiez les confr res d expliquer leur vote par ecrit quand suivent des discussions sur les rapports ou du moins de rester jusqu la fin s ils desirent l expliquer oralement comme ils en ont le droit
french l explication ecrite du vote ce moment est pour chacun de nous une question de respect envers l assemblee
french nous prenons bonne note de votre observation monsieur mastorakis
french rapport sanders ten holte a
french nous nous sommes abstenues sur ce projet m me si nous sommes bien convaincues qu une politique d echanges et de cooperation entre les differents pays dans le domaine de l enseignement contribuerait en ameliorer la qualite en favorisant le brassage des cultures et les echanges entre les peuples qui vivent en europe
french mais une telle orientation ne sera un facteur de progr s que si elle est fondee sur une politique d education des differents etats visant donner des moyens accrus l enseignement public accessible tous
french or cette priorite n est nulle part affirmee dans les textes mais surtout elle n est appliquee dans aucun des pays de l union europeenne
french nous nous inquietons que diverses formulations traduisent une conception limitative et utilitaire d une cooperation dont les objectifs seraient dictes par les imperatifs du marche et les initiatives d entreprises ou d organismes prives la recherche d une main d x uvre qu ils entendent former et qualifier en fonction de leurs besoins
french or introduire les lois du marche dans l education c est en reserver la qualite une minorite en la deteriorant pour la majorite
french c est pourquoi nous avons vote pour les amendements qui mettent en garde contre un r le trop important du marche dans l education
french inutile de dire que la definition de la qualite de l enseignement est une question politique fort complexe puisqu elle depend notamment des objectifs fixes des moyens de les atteindre et des conditions qui president leur realisation
french ainsi la cooperation au niveau europeen sur l evaluation de la qualite et sur les indicateurs de qualite ne doit pas servir produire des mod les d evaluation car il est essentiel de maintenir la diversite des methodes et des approches compte tenu des differents contextes nationaux de la situation historique sociale culturelle et politique de chaque pays
french la cooperation possible sur la base de l echange d experiences concernant l evaluation de la qualite de l enseignement fondamental et secondaire doit donc prendre en consideration le fait que l on se trouve dans un domaine particuli rement sensible qui doit respecter integralement la responsabilite des etats membres pour le contenu de l enseignement et pour l organisation des syst mes d education et de formation ainsi que leur diversite culturelle et linguistique
french rapport mombaur a
french monsieur le president j ai vote favorablement parce qu un considerant prevoit que la concurrence n emp che pas les etats d imposer dans l inter t general des obligations de service public
french je voudrais que dans l application de ce considerant on etablisse qu en ce qui concerne les fournitures de gaz usage domestique on tienne compte du fait que de nombreuses personnes ont des revenus limites parmi lesquelles les retraites qui n ont pas assez pour vivre et qu il faudrait prevoir pour celles ci la fourniture gratuite d une quantite minimale de gaz ou d une autre energie
french dans le fond comme dans chacune de ses formulations ce rapport est un panegyrique de la concurrence et de l economie de marche
french la preoccupation exclusive de son auteur est sous couvert d une unification des marches de l energie en europe de livrer l ensemble de ce secteur au profit prive
french ou plus exactement en separant la production de l electricite et la gestion du reseau de distribution l auteur veut bien consentir aux etats qu ils s occupent de ce qui demande beaucoup d investissements et rapporte peu condition qu ils laissent au prive ce qui rapporte beaucoup
french l unification de la production et de la distribution de l energie l echelle de l ensemble de l union europeenne la planification et la rationalisation de l une comme de l autre pourraient tre un progr s mais la condition que l ensemble reste un service public exclusivement preoccupe par la satisfaction des besoins et pas par la maximisation du profit prive
french la demarche de l auteur du rapport est exactement l inverse
french si le processus de liberalisation qu il pr ne entrait en application cela representerait une regression
french nous avons en consequence vote contre ce rapport
french en tant que nouveau membre de ce parlement je suis choque
french je n ai pas participe la precedente legislature qui a vu la grande braderie de la notion de service public la fran aise je parle bien de braderie l exemple de ce qui a ete fait dans les secteurs des transports de la poste ou encore des telecommunications
french en se proposant d etablir un constat de la transposition des directives de decembre pour l electricite et de juin pour le gaz le rapport mombaur trahit clairement la philosophie ultraliberale de la commission qui demande sous couvert de realisation du marche interieur de l energie au plus grand profit des consommateurs l ouverture totale de ces marches la pleine concurrence
french
french le processus est immuable la commission propose une directive minimaliste en arguant du fait que la liberalisation ne peut tre que profitable dans un contexte de dereglementation ensuite les partisans du toujours plus d europe transposent en allant plus loin au debut de l annee du marche europeen etait liberalise alors que la directive en imposait seulement
french et enfin la commission dans un deuxi me temps regularise de fa on beaucoup plus contraignante une situation de fait
french ceci est d autant plus inacceptable que les probl mes demeurent
french pourquoi realiser un marche unique de l energie alors que l electricite et le gaz ne sont pas comparables en termes de production distribution d evolution du marche de notion de service public
french comment demander un prestataire d assurer une continuite et une equite de service public lorsque ce n est pas rentable economiquement
french parall lement comment demander aux anciens monopoles d assumer aujourd hui une compl te concurrence quand ils doivent continuer amortir de lourds investissements qui sont le produit de choix politiques d hier
french comment demander des prix toujours plus bas au nom d une sacro sainte concurrence sans remettre en cause les exigences actuelles en mati re de securite nucleaire
french comment peut on remplacer la notion nationale de service public par la notion communautaire de mission d inter t general beaucoup plus restrictive
french je pourrais continuer comme cela pendant des pages
french sachez qu il a fallu des decennies de tradition republicaine pour permettre la construction progressive de nos services publics seulement ans de periode de transposition suffiront les aneantir
french d s lors nous n avons pu voter en faveur de ce rapport qui exprime la volonte de l omnipotente commission d aller toujours plus loin et toujours plus vite dans la liberalisation
french certes le liberalisme peut tre souhaitable mais de fa on progressive dose moderee et sans exclure definitivement l interventionnisme public sous peine de devoir subir demain les consequences financi res d une telle renonciation
french la suite des conclusions du sommet europeen de lisbonne des et mars dernier qui a decide d accelerer la liberalisation dans des secteurs comme le gaz l electricite les services postaux et les transports la commissaire europeenne de l energie a presente un ensemble de mesures visant l acceleration de la liberalisation dans le secteur de l electricite incluant la mise en x uvre de mecanismes de concertation aptes depasser les eventuels goulots d etranglement de la liberalisation et negocier avec les pays tiers l acc s au marche communautaire
french comme vous le savez lors du conseil europeen de santa maria da feira la commission a ete invitee presenter un rapport avant mars sur l evolution des marches de l energie dans les termes de la strategie de lisbonne de mani re evaluer les progr s de la liberalisation du marche de l electricite lors du sommet de stockholm en mars
french ainsi avec le soutien des differents gouvernements et durant la presidence portugaise differents mecanismes de pression ont ete renforces afin d accelerer le processus dej en cours avec la directive sur l electricite de decembre qui prevoyait l ouverture du marche par phases en procedant graduellement jusque quant la directive de relative au gaz naturel elle prevoit la derni re phase d ouverture de ce secteur en ce qui a de graves consequences pour le portugal en particulier pour edp ses travailleurs et les consommateurs portugais
french de cette mani re on renvoie au second plan la fois les probl mes de l emploi des travailleurs des entreprises de ce secteur et les inter ts de chaque etat membre y compris la defense d un service public de qualite au service des inter ts des consommateurs ce qui ne peut susciter que notre compl te opposition
french el l objectif du rapport en question est de justifier la liberalisation du secteur de l energie principalement de l energie electrique mais aussi du gaz naturel
french en substance il enl ve l etat ce secteur productif d importance strategique et livre toute son activite au capital prive afin que celui ci multiplie ses gains
french l etat est reduit au r le de regulateur des inter ts monopolistiques et de superviseur des directions dont l ue decide au detriment de l economie du pays et de l inter t du peuple
french la reflexion qui soutient tout le rapport ne tient nullement compte des inter ts populaires ceux du simple citoyen ni m me du developpement de chaque pays mais des inter ts des grands monopoles
french le rapport dans un effort d embellir la liberalisation du secteur de l energie comporte un bon nombre d inexactitudes
french par exemple il n est pas vrai qu en grande bretagne la concurrence ait favorise la diminution des prix et l augmentation des emplois
french dans les quatre ou cinq annees qui ont suivi la privatisation de l energie electrique il s est au contraire produit une forte hausse des prix une reduction du personnel l abandon du trace d un programme national long terme de developpement de l energie electrique
french ailleurs le rapport lui m me reconna t la suppression d emplois en consequence la liberalisation mais estime qu il y aura augmentation des emplois dans des branches non productives bourse publicite entreprises de courtage etc
french d apr s une etude elaboree au sein de l entreprise publique d electricite en gr ce la liberalisation de l energie electrique fera chuter son personnel de personnes abolissant du m me coup un grand nombre de services utiles autant l entreprise publique d electricite qu l economie du pays tels que la promotion de nouvelles technologies les etudes de centrales etc
french la privatisation et la liberalisation entra neront une hausse des prix particuli rement considerable pour les consommateurs des petites les de la mer egee qui paient actuellement le kilowatt un prix moins cher que son co t
french il est tout aussi inadmissible d obliger une entreprise de service public mettre tout un reseau de transport et de distribution d une valeur enorme la disposition du secteur prive au nom de la soi disant concurrence
french si l ue souhaitait une concurrence saine dans le sens qu elle donne elle m me ce terme elle devrait plut t obliger les particuliers creer leurs propres reseaux et leurs propres unites de production afin de concurrencer les entreprises de service public et non pas contraindre ces derni res faire cadeau de leur reseau leurs concurrents
french simplement de cette mani re elles veulent faciliter le transfert de la richesse au grand capital
french exactement pour la m me raison est entreprise la separation des branches afin que toute entreprise de service public ne puisse pas fonctionner de mani re obtenir le meilleur resultat de ses activites verticales et pas consequent ne soit pas concurrentielles
french l energie n est pas un simple produit de consommation
french le secteur de l energie est particuli rement important pour le developpement economique d un pays et vital pour sa defense
french par consequent la liberalisation des marches energetiques met en danger non seulement la securite d un pays mais aussi son developpement
french ce danger appara t clairement puisque ainsi qu il est souligne dans le rapport les entreprises de service public doivent operer sur le marche europeen dans l europe sans fronti res
french ces entreprises ne sont plus strictement nationales et les actionnaires non plus
french pour ces raisons les deputes europeens du gue ngl votent contre le rapport de m p m mombaur
french je me rejouis de constater que les efforts deployes en vue de liberaliser le secteur energetique semblent veritablement porter leurs fruits
french la plupart des pays se sont petit petit atteles apporter des modifications structurelles de grande envergure au marche
french certains pays ont dej opere une liberalisation totale et je suis particuli rement ravi de pouvoir declarer que le danemark fait partie de ce groupe de t te
french l instar de ce qui s est dej passe en su de notamment le danemark devrait tirer parti de cette position favorable pour achever ce processus de liberalisation
french je regrette par consequent l absence apparente de plan de la part du gouvernement danois pour franchir la derni re etape vers une liberalisation totale
french l excellent rapport de m mombaur aborde juste titre plusieurs points
french il convient en particulier de souligner l importance de prendre d s present en consideration la situation des pays candidats une adhesion
french la liberalisation du marche de l energie dans les pays de l est necessitera des mesures particuli res et il faudra porter une attention speciale l environnement
french il convient egalement d attirer l attention sur la necessite de rendre toute production d electricite transparente et sur le fait que toute aide en faveur de ce secteur ne pourra en aucun cas entra ner une distorsion de concurrence
french rapport radwan a
french monsieur le president le rapport annuel de la banque centrale europeenne pour n est pas tr s prolixe sur la grande question que se posent tous les observateurs pourquoi l euro qui etait annonce comme une monnaie forte s av re t il tre finalement une monnaie faible
french la banque consacre une page sur pr s de deux cents ce sujet avec un tout petit graphique o l on trouve seulement le constat de l affaiblissement de l euro
french quant aux explications la seule fournie est la difference de sante economique et de structures entre l europe et les etats unis
french c est vrai mais c est insuffisant
french il faudrait mentionner d abord que l europe n est pas un pays avec un peuple un etat un gouvernement economique et qu en consequence l euro est generalement considere comme plus fragile qu une monnaie nationale
french de plus il a ete lance l origine un niveau trop eleve precisement parce qu on l a evalue partir du cours existant de veritables monnaies nationales alors qu il ne poss de pas leurs qualites intrins ques
french comment les responsables europeens veulent ils lutter contre cette depreciation
french d abord indirectement au moyen de politiques favorables la croissance et nous ne pouvons qu approuver cette categorie d actions
french mais en m me temps on voit la banque centrale europeenne relever les taux d inter t officiellement pour lutter contre une inflation qui n existe pas en realite pour soutenir la parite de l euro
french c est une arme double tranchant car utilisee un mauvais moment du cycle elle peut casser la croissance que l on s efforce de ranimer par ailleurs
french autre solution douteuse la fuite en avant par le renforcement de l euro onze qui devrait mener progressivement vers un gouvernement economique de l europe
french cela ne changera pas grand chose court terme
french pour aller au fond du probl me il faudrait enlever toute autonomie aux nations d europe mais c est evidemment impossible
french en tout cas parall lement se met en place un verrouillage du syst me
french comme je l ai explique un recent colloque de l assemblee nationale fran aise la charte des droits fondamentaux aura pour fonction entre autres de ligoter encore plus les peuples vis vis du droit communautaire et donc aussi vis vis de la monnaie unique
french cette aventure contribue nous mener la perte de nos libertes
french monsieur le president il ne s agit pas d explications de vote mais bien d une poursuite du debat
french je ne sais pas encore comment m berthu a vote non pas que cela m interesse mais il ne s agit pas d une explication de vote simplement de la poursuite du debat
french monsieur le president j ai vote en faveur du rapport radwan bien qu au point qui figure en page on demande d accelerer les reformes structurelles des syst mes de securite sociale par une formulation qui pour ainsi dire me laisse perplexe
french que cache donc si souvent formulee ainsi la demande de diminuer les prestations aux citoyens pour reduire les depenses des gouvernements nationaux
french si telle etait l intention du rapport je voudrais dire que l on devrait plut t y voir une rationalisation destinee eviter les gaspillages dans les paiements des aides qui si elles ete mieux gerees eviteraient que l on doive sans cesse reduire les prestations et donc les pensions versees aux personnes gees en europe
french le rapport l examen fait l apologie des politiques monetaristes de la banque centrale europeenne bce en particulier de la stabilite des prix en oubliant que nous ne vivons pas actuellement un moment de baisse continue des taux mais au contraire une phase de hausses croissantes avec des repercussions tr s graves sur les revenus des familles bas revenus qui recourent au credit bancaire pour se loger comme au portugal
french pour le rapporteur qui se felicite de l action de la bce ce qui compte c est le respect strict des crit res de convergence nominale du pacte de stabilite y compris pour les pays candidats l adhesion et les politiques qui lui sont associees en particulier la moderation salariale la flexibilite du marche du travail et des syst mes de securite sociale et l acceleration de la liberalisation dans les secteurs des services et des capitaux
french il en arrive m me critiquer les pays de la zone euro qui ont reduit la duree du travail car pour lui ce comportement contribue rigidifier le marche du travail plut t qu l assouplir
french de cette mani re le rapporteur se met dans la position de defendre le neoliberalisme capitaliste le plus raffine ce qui merite uniquement une protestation vehemente de notre part travers notre vote contraire
french rapport karas a
french monsieur le president il s agit du rapport du parlement europeen sur la strategie de communication adopter dans la derni re phase d application de l union monetaire rapport contre lequel j ai vote pour que mme peijs comprenne bien
french ce rapport refl te le souci de beaucoup de responsables devant le desinter t peu pr s total du public pour la mise en place de l euro
french pourtant nous ne sommes qu un an et demi d une echeance capitale le retrait des monnaies nationales et la mise en circulation physique des pi ces et billets libelles en euros
french jusqu present certes la partie s est averee relativement facile pour l euro puisque la premi re phase a concerne surtout des techniciens banquiers investisseurs et usagers de bourses de valeurs tous dej bien avertis et d ailleurs dans l ensemble convaincus d avance
french dans ces conditions la facilite de l implantation de l euro dans cette phase ne surprend pas
french mais partir de maintenant c est une partie beaucoup plus difficile qui va se jouer la rencontre avec le citoyen qui bien souvent n a pas encore bien compris quels efforts allaient lui tre demandes et qui va se retrouver piege par les decisions dej prises
french pour compenser cette lacune le parlement europeen demande d intensifier la politique de communication en augmentant les credits d environ jusqu millions d euros par an
french pour decomplexer les decideurs qui auraient des doutes il ajoute avec une certaine ingenuite je cite la resolution votee que conformement l article paragraphe a de l accord interinstitutionnel du mai la politique d information constitue une activite autonome ne necessitant aucune base juridique
french dans ces conditions en effet pourquoi se priver
french je souligne au passage que nous avons toujours conteste la possibilite pour la commission d engager des depenses sans base juridique et nous avons conteste cet accord interinstitutionnel que le conseil a eu la faiblesse d accepter en contradiction avec les principes habituels d une bonne gestion des deniers publics
french monsieur le president je repondrai aux attentes de mme peijs et me bornerai dire que j ai vote en faveur de ce rapport avec l espoir que tous les retraites recevront le decembre une calculatrice convertissant leur monnaie en euros
french monsieur le president je fais partie des deputes qui ont depose l amendement pour que la campagne d information de la commission sur l euro se limite aux pays qui font partie de l actuelle union monetaire
french cela signifie que la su de le danemark et la grande bretagne doivent rester en dehors dans la mesure o la couronne et la livre sont toujours les devises de ces pays
french c est une demande bien fondee pour que l ue n entame pas dans les etats membres des campagnes financees par des taxes sur des questions de politique interieure sensibles
french au fond il est question de la tolerance vis vis de chacun et du respect du processus democratique de chaque peuple
french les deputes sociaux democrates danois ont ce jour vote pour le rapport de m karas sur la strategie de communication adopter durant la mise en place de l uem
french l introduction des nouveaux billets communs et des nouvelles pi ces de monnaie communes aura une tr s grande importance sur le plan pratique pour les citoyens et les entreprises pas seulement parce que les pi ces et les billets seront neufs mais parce qu il faudra s habituer aux nouveaux prix exprimes dans la monnaie commune
french l argent est une chose dans laquelle il faut avoir confiance
french nous devons par consequent disposer des informations requises et ces informations doivent tre plus compl tes que celles dont nous disposons lorsque les pays introduisent de nos jours un nouveau dessin sur les billets et les pi ces
french nous avons insiste l occasion de notre vote sur la necessite de veiller ce que les campagnes d information soient menees dans les differents pays par les etats membres et que les differents pays concluent des accords specifiques ce propos
french il est exact de declarer que le gouvernement danois n a pas conclu un tel accord mais nous esperons que le danemark le fera apr s que la population danoise se soit prononcee nous l esperons en faveur de la monnaie commune l occasion du referendum prevu le septembre
french nl mon parti le parti socialiste aux pays bas n a jamais ete un partisan de l introduction h tive d une monnaie commune pour les pays de l union europeenne
french l euro nous emp che de reguler l economie par l adaptation des taux d inter t et des taux de change
french la pretendue stabilite de l euro est en outre obtenue au prix d importantes economies sur les revenus des personnes ne travaillant pas et sur les fonds accordes l enseignement la sante publique le logement et les transports publics
french j estime d s lors que l euro est un element pratique uniquement pour les hommes d affaires les joyeux vacanciers et les membres du parlement europeen mais pas pour la grande majorite des citoyens
french pour autant qu il y ait eu une certaine confiance en l euro celle ci a entre temps fortement regresse maintenant que la valeur de l euro a diminue par rapport la couronne danoise la couronne suedoise la livre britannique et aux devises de nombreux pays ne faisant pas partie de l union europeenne
french je peux d s lors concevoir que les partisans de l euro aient present besoin d une campagne de propagande
french le rapport karas vise principalement augmenter la confiance du grand public vis vis de l euro en faisant notamment appel aux associations sportives et l enseignement
french ce rapport souhaite d autre part denoncer les pratiques d escrocs et d autres personnes qui profitent de l introduction de l euro pour augmenter leurs prix
french pour ce qui est de cet element je suis enti rement d accord mais je n ai pu approuver la proposition dans son ensemble
french c est en bloc que je rejette le rapport karas
french si l objectif de familiariser les europeens avec leur future monnaie est parfaitement legitime puisque le choix d abandonner les monnaies nationales a ete fait dans des conditions que je condamne je refuse de toutes mes forces la propagande que ce texte organise en faveur de ce que m karas appelle un element essentiel du processus d integration europeenne qui contribue forger l identite europeenne
french ce texte a au moins le merite d exposer au grand jour l enorme mensonge auquel les partisans d une europe federale ont eu recours lorsqu en ils ont demande aux fran ais de ratifier le traite de maastricht la monnaie unique etait alors presentee comme un instrument purement technique visant un meilleur fonctionnement de l economie face au dollar et au yen et comme une operation parfaitement neutre en mati re de souverainete nationale
french comme nous etions loin alors de l element essentiel du processus d integration
french ce texte sera n en doutons pas une arme essentielle pour tous ceux qui en grande bretagne en su de et au danemark combattent pour preserver leurs democraties nationales l euro est bien m me si ses partisans le nient aujourd hui dans ces pays la machine de guerre d une europe federale que l ecrasante majorite de leurs populations refuse
french alors quand mes coll gues rejettent l amendement depose par william abitbol qui demande simplement que cet objectif integrationniste soit clairement expose dans les programmes de communication de la commission ils contribuent une operation de propagande mensong re que leurs electeurs sanctionneront certainement
french la resolution du rapport karas pretend que les femmes pour des raisons inexpliquees ne participent pas l enthousiasme general qui aurait d accompagner la mise en place de l euro
french on retrouve ici les accents desagreables des propagandistes revolutionnaires de toutes les epoques qui voient dans chaque foyer un complot reactionnaire des jupons et de la calotte pour refuser des lendemains qui chantent
french il n est semble t il venu l esprit de personne que c est peut tre en raison de leur experience en mati re d economie quotidienne que les femmes sont plus que reticentes au passage l euro
french voil qui est meprisable et trahit bien la dictature de la pensee unique qui consiste taxer les opposants les opposantes ou les reticents l euro d ignorants d analphab tes de sous developpes
french voyez quoi m ne l aveuglement federaliste
french rapport lambert a
french les rapports d activite annuels du mediateur et de la commission des petitions font partie des traditions de cette maison
french aux bilans de ces deux organes le parlement repond son tour par deux rapports assez semblables d une annee sur l autre
french une nouveaute cependant le rapport thors s appuyant notamment sur les travaux de la commission constitutionnelle et sur la demande de m s derman pretend donner au mediateur un droit d acc s general tous les documents dont la consultation est necessaire l instruction des plaintes
french nous nous opposons cette proposition non pas parce que nous refuserions tout contr le sur l administration mais parce que de tels pouvoirs vont au del des competences d un mediateur pour atteindre celles d un juge
french il est evident et ce n est certainement pas nous qui dirons le contraire que la delirante administration communautaire et les mefaits qu elle engendre ne peuvent que creer chez nos concitoyens une insatisfaction grandissante et partant engendrer des recours de plus en plus nombreux
french la multiplication des competences la diversification des domaines d intervention la boulimie legislative de la commission et de notre assemblee n arrangeront sans doute pas ce phenom ne
french mais ce n est pas le mediateur et ses quelques collaborateurs qui pourront repondre correctement ces defis
french il est de notre responsabilite politique de tarir les sources m mes de ces litiges en preferant la qualite de notre travail un activisme textuel qui justifierait notre existence en respectant reellement le principe de subsidiarite qui evitera l union de se prononcer sur des sujets qui ne la concernent pas en exer ant nous m mes le cas echeant les competences que nous possedons en mati re de contr le des organes communautaires
french nous avons vu trop souvent notre assemblee se refugier derri re des comites d experts parce qu elle refusait d assumer ses propres responsabilites politiques
french s il faut laisser au mediateur le contr le des probl mes d intendance administrative il nous faut apprendre de notre c te ma triser en amont et en aval la folle machine communautaire lancee dans une fuite en avant mortelle
french les exc s combattre sont souvent le fruit de la nature m me de l actuelle construction europeenne et c est donc la racine qu il faut les combattre
french rapport atkins a
french monsieur le president on ne pourra pas dire que je ne reponds pas aux attentes de mme peijs
french j ai en effet vote en faveur du rapport atkins parce que pour les pensionnes qui n ont plus beaucoup de temps vivre la ponctualite des avions est tr s importante precisement parce qu il leur reste peu de temps
french ette periode de session est riche en rapports relatifs aux transports
french helas je dois constater que c est uniquement sous l angle liberal que l on envisage ce secteur
french le rapport de m atkins qui traite de la proposition de la commission europeenne relative au ciel unique s inscrit dans cette logique de liberalisation tout va
french c est ce qui a provoque la gr ve des contr leurs aeriens fran ais la semaine derni re
french ils ont ainsi exprime leurs inquietudes face une conception uniquement commerciale de leur profession
french je comprends leur mouvement ce qui n est certainement pas le cas de m atkins qui dans son rapport invite la commission exhorter les gouvernements des etats membres qui actuellement tol rent que les conflits du travail nationaux perturbent le trafic aerien s attaquer d urgence ce probl me
french c est derisoire
french personne ne nie la realite de la degradation de la situation du trafic aerien
french effectivement les couloirs aeriens et les aeroports sont satures les retards sont monnaie courante puisqu un avion sur trois n arrive pas l heure prevue tout cela etant accompagne d un cort ge de nuisances sonores et environnementales
french je veux donc saluer la volonte de mme de palacio la commissaire en charge du dossier transport de prendre le probl me bras le corps afin d arriver rapidement la creation d un ciel unique europeen
french cependant je suis en total desaccord avec les moyens qu elle nous presente tout comme je desapprouve les propositions du rapport
french il s agit en effet de mettre en concurrence les centres de contr le aerien en dissociant les autorites de regulation et les operateurs
french la fonction de contr le pourrait s exercer au sein de societes separees dont le capital serait ouvert aux compagnies aeriennes ou des partenaires prives
french cette liberalisation conduirait fragiliser la securite dans les transports aeriens ce qui est bien entendu inacceptable et en contradiction avec le traite ce aux termes duquel l amelioration de la securite des transports constitue l un des principaux objectifs de la politique commune des transports
french certes la france appara t comme un cas isole en europe o le contr le aerien dans la plupart des pays est gere par des agences sous tutelle de l etat mais ouvertes aux capitaux prives
french la france tient maintenir ces activites dans le service public
french il faut appliquer ici le principe de subsidiarite et laisser chaque etat membre ma tre de l organisation du contr le aerien
french c est une exigence d autant plus que le probl me des retards ne vient pas du contr le aerien qui n est responsable que de moins de des retards
french en conclusion je soutiens les propositions qui visent renforcer le r le d eurocontrol l agence paneuropeenne responsable de la gestion de l espace aerien d etats europeens membres ou non de l ue en tant qu autorite reglementaire
french le rapport sous estime tort le potentiel de cette agence et j ai vote contre un rapport parfaitement inacceptable
french j ai vote contre le rapport de m atkins car il est en total decalage avec la realite et s inscrit dans une vision d a priori ideologique plus que dans le souci de repondre aux besoins reels de nos concitoyens et des usagers du transport aerien
french bien s r il ne s agit pas de nier la necessite d ameliorer la situation de la regulation et du contr le aerien en europe dans l esprit du ciel unique europeen
french c est une evidence que les avions qui traversent nos airs ne sauraient tre tributaires de traitements incoherents non coordonnes compliques de leur passage
french et il est vrai que si des progr s ont ete engages avec eurocontrol le temps est dej venu de franchir une nouvelle etape et d ameliorer le dispositif avec un imperatif majeur qui doit passer au dessus de tout la securite la regulation et le contr le aerien ne doivent pas relever de la loi de la concurrence mais bien du concept de service d inter t general
french d ailleurs les etats unis n ont jamais liberalise leur contr le aerien puisque c est une agence d etat qui le g re
french c est tout dire
french or tout le rapport atkins vise cet objectif de mise en concurrence d un service dont on voit mal comment il pourrait tre source de profit prive et qui trouverait ses crit res de performance dans les profits degages
french par ailleurs les pretextes donnes pour accelerer cette liberalisation sont les retards des avions
french en effet il convient d y remedier mais pour tre efficace il convient d analyser les raisons effectives de ceux ci et les solutions reelles
french notons d abord qu il y a des evolutions positives cette annee car les retards ont diminue et de fa on substantielle en france
french cela montre d abord qu il convient de faire la part entre les dysfonctionnements conjoncturels usage de l espace par les militaires pour le kosovo changement du syst me de contr le etc
french et structurels
french il faut aussi mesurer tout ce qui rel ve des compagnies aeriennes ou de l etroitesse de l espace civil europeen au regard du nombre des survols
french la part du contr le aerien dans ces retards n est pas gigantesque au bout du compte et en tout cas l amelioration du syst me passe par une meilleure organisation de la coordination des differents syst mes de contr le dans les etats membres en confortant eurocontrol dans ce r le
french voil ce que devraient tre la priorite et les lignes directrices du ciel unique europeen
french helas la commission ne semble pas sur cette ligne et le rapport atkins appara t pire encore
french le secteur du trafic aerien est organise de longue date de mani re particuli rement liberale
french cela est d la concurrence des autorites entre elles afin de proposer un nombre sans cesse plus important d aeroports toujours plus grands et au fait qu en dehors de ces aeroports aucune infrastructure comparable aux voies ferrees et aux autoroutes n est necessaire
french il est de ce fait normal depuis toujours dans ce secteur que differentes compagnies se fassent concurrence sur un m me itineraire
french les prix des billets d avion temoignent egalement de cette liberte
french inutile de chercher un lien entre la distance parcourir et le prix du vol
french les vols pour lesquels un nombre plus important de passagers est souhaite sont bon marche le prix des vols pour lesquels on estime qu il y a plus qu assez de passagers est eleve
french dans ce secteur il n y a plus grand chose liberaliser
french certaines personnes esp rent pourtant trouver en poussant la liberalisation encore plus loin un rem de miracle tous les maux
french cela aurait pour consequence une reduction du prix des billets une offre plus importante de vols et la suppression des retards
french le groupe de la gauche unitaire europeenne trouve cette evaluation particuli rement simpliste celle ci se limitant deux inter ts d une part celui des compagnies aeriennes d autre part celui du consommateur dont le seul objectif est un nombre toujours plus important de vols toujours moins chers
french pour nous d autres points sont plus importants tels que la securite des passagers la garantie d emploi et les conditions de travail du personnel la protection de l environnement et la protection des chemins de fer contre le dumping et autres formes de concurrence deloyale
french tenir le personnel qui se voit parfois contraint de se mettre en gr ve pour se proteger responsable de tout ce qui peut provoquer l enervement des passagers n a gu re de sens
french la faute n est pas non plus imputer eurocontrol qui a repris un certain nombre de t ches etatiques transfrontali res
french la securite ne doit pas passer apr s la course aux benefices des societes souhaitant reprendre le marche d eurocontrol
french le probl me se situe bien plus au niveau de la croissance excessive du trafic aerien et de la concurrence par les prix au detriment du transport ferroviaire sur les longues distances
french ce probl me ne sera pas resolu avec les propositions actuelles
french nous avons presente de ce point de vue critique amendements
french maintenant qu il s est avere qu une majorite du parlement ne soutenait pas notre vision nous n avons pas pu approuver la version definitive du rapport atkins
french le present rapport tout en partant de certaines situations reelles comme l augmentation du trafic aerien ou les retards constates sur certaines routes et de certaines affirmations correctes en particulier la necessite de garantir et renforcer la securite du transport aerien escamote cependant les causes profondes de ces situations qui sont indissociables des liberalisations successives au niveau des transports aeriens et de la concurrence effrenee qui en decoule
french il tire surtout des conclusions precipitees et erronees car fortement orientees vers la liberalisation de l espace aerien et le contr le respectif par les principaux transporteurs aeriens l avenir
french il faut bien s r une cooperation effective et des mesures techniques indispensables et regulatrices dans ce domaine mais nous ne sommes pas d accord avec ces orientations encore plus liberales que celles de la commission
french si elles sont adoptees elles accentueront les difficultes dans le domaine de la securite et elles conduiront des probl mes sociaux accrus en plus des questions soulevees dans le cadre de la souverainete de chaque etat sur son espace aerien d autant plus importantes dans la mesure o elles sont partagees par les aviations militaires respectives
french le juin les aiguilleurs du ciel fran ais etaient en gr ve pour protester contre les projets de l union europeenne de liberalisation du contr le aerien je tiens manifester ma solidarite avec cette gr ve et avec les revendications des syndicats du contr le aerien
french les reponses la saturation de l espace aerien europeen entra nent une fuite en avant par la multiplication des aeroports et des pistes la degradation des conditions de travail des salaries du secteur et l augmentation des nuisances
french nous nous pronon ons au contraire pour un developpement harmonise des transports l echelle europeenne qui donne la priorite la satisfaction des besoins sociaux reels et qui choisisse par exemple la voie ferroviaire pour les besoins du plus grand nombre notamment pour les distances inferieures kilom tres
french liberaliser le contr le aerien ne resoudra pas le probl me des retards puisque ceux ci ne sont imputables que pour au contr le
french on sait que les militaires accaparent aujourd hui en france par exemple de l espace aerien
french pourquoi ceci n est il pas remis en cause
french la commission prend pretexte des retards pour aller vers une separation entre un office europeen de regulation et la mise en place d un marche interieur privatise pour les fournitures de services de trafic aerien
french de telles mesures prises sous la pression du lobbying des compagnies aeriennes ne pourront se faire qu au detriment de la securite d autant plus que les compagnies elles m mes pourront se porter candidates pour de telles prestations de services
french c est pour ces raisons que j ai vote contre ce rapport
french rapport dami o a
french monsieur le president j ai vote en faveur du rapport dami o notamment parce que j ai vote en faveur de l amendement prevoyant cent pour cent des indemnites de maternite
french la maternite n est pas une maladie
french ce matin je lisais dans les journaux italiens que l on detaxerait les soins aux chiens et aux chats
french d s lors s il y a de l argent pour les animaux il doit aussi y en avoir pour les femmes qui accouchent qui ne sont pas malades mais qui sont des personnes ayant droit une indemnite compl te
french monsieur le president ce rapport sur les mesures visant promouvoir l amelioration de la securite et de la sante des travailleuses enceintes accouchees ou allaitantes au travail est tr s honorable et va dans la bonne direction
french le point en particulier comporte de nombreuses propositions positives
french je voudrais par la m me occasion mettre en garde contre une evolution qui implique que nous nous consacrions au sein du parlement europeen la politique sociale et la legislation sociale ce qui mon avis est tout point de vue du ressort des etats membres
french c est un point tr s important de l identite culturelle et sociale que chaque peuple et chaque pays fa onnent
french c est une des questions les plus importantes de chaque campagne electorale en su de et dans d autres pays
french faisons en sorte que cela reste une question nationale
french monsieur le president la femme enceinte et son enfant na tre les femmes qui viennent d accoucher et qui allaitent doivent tre soutenus autant que possible pendant cette periode qui est tr s importante non seulement pour la m re et son enfant mais aussi pour la societe si l on tient compte du faible taux de naissance et du vieillissement de la population en europe aujourd hui
french il est clair que les employeurs ont des responsabilites sociales mais les gouvernements devraient montrer l exemple tout specialement dans des pays comme le mien o le r le de la m re et celui de la famille sont proteges par la constitution
french malheureusement la situation semble tre differente en irlande en ce qui concerne les conges de maternite remuneres les moyens mis en x uvre pour faciliter l allaitement et la dispense de travail de nuit
french je cite ces exemples pour souligner le fait qu il ne suffit pas d adopter une directive pour qu elle soit appliquee
french il est grand temps de cesser de faire des promesses en l air aux m res qui travaillent leurs enfants et leurs familles dans notre communaute europeenne
french nous avons vote dans ce rapport les paragraphes qui vont dans le sens de la protection de la femme travailleuse tant du point de vue de sa sante et de son salaire que du point de vue de la sante de l enfant
french il est cependant deplorable que le rapport ne propose m me pas d aligner dans tous les domaines les avantages et les droits sur les pays o ils sont les plus favorables aux femmes enceintes qui travaillent
french par ailleurs nous ne voulons pas que notre vote en faveur de la protection specifique pendant leur grossesse des femmes travaillant la nuit puisse tre interprete comme la reconnaissance de la legitimite du travail de nuit des femmes
french nous tenons au contraire reaffirmer notre opposition au travail de nuit quand ce n est pas socialement utile non seulement pour les femmes mais aussi pour les hommes
french l interdiction du travail de nuit des femmes etait un acquis du mouvement ouvrier en france
french revenir l dessus est une regression sociale
french invoquer l egalite entre hommes et femmes y ajoute l hypocrisie
french une hypocrisie destinee masquer le fait que le legislateur tient plus assurer aux patrons l utilisation profitable de leurs materiels qu garantir la sante et la securite de leurs salaries
french je me suis abstenu lors du vote sur l amendement soumis au nom de m bushill matthews qui en appelait la necessite de reconna tre les besoins specifiques des pme lors de la mise en x uvre de la legislation relative la sante et la securite
french je partage son souhait mais l amendement est superflu puisque l article du traite mentionne clairement que les directives caract re social y compris celles qui concernent la sante et la securite des travailleurs doivent eviter d imposer des contraintes administratives financi res et juridiques telles qu elles contrarieraient la creation et le developpement de petites et moyennes entreprises
french je pense donc que les points exprimes dans l amendement sont dej couverts et qu il est inutile de les repeter dans ce rapport
french el nous nous trouvons une fois de plus devant une avalanche de bonnes intentions qui m me lorsqu elles aboutissent la redaction de propositions positives sont condamnees rester lettre morte puisqu elles ne saisissent pas l essence du probl me ni m me n effleurent la principale raison qui le cree
french la proposition du parlement europeen comporte nombre d elements positifs qui cependant sont annules en raison de sa propre faiblesse poser globalement le probl me des developpements negatifs dans le cadre du travail et des relations de travail
french partir du moment o n est m me pas effleure le probl me capital de la restructuration des relations de travail de la reduction et de l abolition des droits fondamentaux et des acquis des travailleurs partir du moment o est aussi occulte le probl me des conditions de travail flexibilisation du temps et des conditions de travail travail temporaire et temps partiel reduction de la securite et de la protection sociales le cadre dans lequel est con ue la proposition est totalement negatif et suspensif pour l application d une quelconque politique en faveur de la protection des travailleuses avant et apr s la grossesse
french nous voudrions que soit accordee une importance particuli re tout en soulignant les dangers afferents la stricte interdiction des licenciements notamment l heure actuelle o se sont largement generalisees les conventions de travail atypiques aux barrages indirects qui font obstacle au recrutement des femmes enceintes la necessite non seulement de proteger et garantir le conge de maternite mais aussi d en allonger la duree au besoin de definir plus clairement les allocations de maternite au maintien de contr les plus stricts et plus consistants relativement au travail de nuit des travailleuses enceintes et accouchees
french d une part il est indispensable de renforcer le cadre juridique necessaire la protection de la securite et de la sante des femmes enceintes en comblant ses lacunes et eclaircissant ses obscurites chevaux de troie augurant de son alteration et de sa violation d autre part il faut faire face l absence de volonte politique conduisant l application effective de la directive par les gouvernements des etats membres absence facilement demontrable si l on examine la position des mecanismes de contr le des etats membres au cours de la periode precedente
french cet egard l exemple de la gr ce est caracteristique si l on consid re l absence de contr les quant l obligation impartie l employeur de rediger une evaluation circonstanciee des risques professionnels encourus sur les lieux du travail dans laquelle doit aussi tre inclue l analyse precise des risques pour les travailleuses enceintes et accouchees
french la realite demontre que lorsque l employabilite et l adaptabilite rel vent de la ligne directrice des priorites communautaires dans les questions de l emploi toute protection se rev le inexistante et en pratique les r glements specifiques sont annules
french le probl me est de savoir quelles sont les directions qui sont donnees quel genre de politique de l emploi est exercee
french et malheureusement l ue elle nous le confirme persiste dans une limitation drastique des allocations et de la securite sociale amende pour le pire les dispositions concernant les licenciements la reduction ou l abolition des mesures de protection dans le cadre des conditions de travail
french aucune illusion n est plus permise ni sur le caract re de la politique de l emploi et generalement de la politique sociale de l ue ni sur les inter ts qu elle sert c est la raison pour laquelle m me si nous nous partageons le positionnement positif du parlement europeen dans la question de la protection des travailleuses enceintes nous pensons qu il ne s agit une fois de plus que d un expose d idees et de bonnes intentions
french aussi appelons nous les travailleuses et les travailleurs poursuivre leurs luttes sociales pour parvenir un changement d ensemble de la politique du travail et la promotion d une nouvelle politique axee sur l homme sur le respect de ses besoins et de sa dignite
french des luttes dont l objectif primordial est la realisation du principe du plein emploi et de la stabilite de l emploi ainsi que la protection des droits acquis et reconnus pour tous
french ce n est que dans ce cadre que peuvent tre garantis les droits de cette categorie particuli rement sensible des femmes enceintes les droits et le respect de la vie qui n est pas une mati re premi re objet de profit et ne repond pas aux lois du co t de la concurrence et du marche impitoyable
french nous sommes favorables toutes les modifications de la directive visant ameliorer la protection des salariees enceintes avant pendant et apr s leur conge de maternite
french la resolution propose de combler les lacunes de l actuelle directive et d harmoniser les legislations europeennes pour les aligner sur celles qui garantissent le plus de droits
french nous souscrivons de telles propositions au nom de la garantie du droit la sante des salaries et ce d autant plus que les projets de modification de la convention sur la protection de la maternite de l oit convention laissent entrevoir de nombreux reculs tels que l exclusion de certaines femmes du benefice du conge maternite la duree minimale de ce conge et la possibilite de licencier une femme pendant son conge
french il est necessaire de fixer un cadre europeen rigoureux pour proteger les femmes enceintes contre toute discrimination pendant l embauche sur la question de leurs conditions de travail sur l acc s et la duree du conge maternite semaines dont obligatoires apr s l accouchement
french elles doivent tre protegees contre tout licenciement abusif et leur salaire anterieur doit tre garanti
french enfin il faut interdire le travail de nuit pour les femmes et les hommes dans les secteurs o il n est pas indispensable plut t que de chercher l amenager pour les femmes enceintes
french developpement du transport maritime courte distance
french l ordre du jour appelle le rapport a de mme peijs au nom de la commission de la politique regionale des transports et du tourisme sur la communication de la commission au conseil au parlement europeen au comite economique et social et au comite des regions le developpement du transport maritime courte distance en europe une alternative dynamique dans une cha ne de transport durable deuxi me rapport d avancement bisannuel com c cos
french je c de la parole mme peijs rapporteur
french monsieur le president en la commission a presente sur la base de la strategie formulee dans le livre blanc sur une politique commune des transports une communication sur le developpement du transport maritime courte distance
french nous en sommes actuellement au deuxi me rapport d avancement bisannuel sur ce sujet
french cependant apr s cinq ans il est clair que le transport maritime courte distance n est toujours qu une belle promesse qui n est pas tenue malgre le soutien oral du conseil des ministres des transports du decembre qui considerait le transport maritime courte distance comme une priorite
french nous ne tentons pas pour des motifs idealistes d imposer le transport maritime courte distance
french il s agit du fait que le transport augmentera ces dix prochaines annees de
french il est impossible de satisfaire cette demande croissante au moyen du seul transport par route
french le transport maritime courte distance ne represente d s lors pas un concurrent pour le transport par route le transport ferroviaire ou le transport sur les voies navigables interieures il s agit d une alternative dans la cha ne de transport
french nous avons tous inter t limiter le plus possible l irritation des communautes d habitation vis vis du transport de marchandises continu grande vitesse
french le transport doit egalement tre le moins polluant possible et sur ce plan aussi le transport maritime courte distance repond de hautes exigences
french la rapidite n est peut tre pas la caracteristique principale du transport maritime courte distance la securite bien
french les interdictions de circuler le week end et les embouteillages sont des fleaux pour le transport par route
french dans de nombreux cas le transport maritime courte distance peut constituer une solution ces probl mes s il est utilise pour completer d autres formes de transport
french je n entends d ailleurs pas pretendre que cela represente une solution dans tous les cas
french nous pouvons dej remedier de nombreux probl mes en nous attelant serieusement utiliser tous les modes de transport de fa on optimale et en les combinant le mieux possible
french mais pour ce faire il faut repondre un certain nombre de conditions
french dans sa communication la commission attire expressement l attention sur les entreprises elles m mes
french c est possible mais en tant que rapporteur je voudrais cependant apporter une certaine nuance
french pour certains points tr s clairs ce sont avant tout les autorites nationales locales et regionales qui peuvent peser dans la balance et donner une impulsion au transport maritime courte distance
french dans sa communication la commission europeenne expose l affaire
french le parlement et votre rapporteur ont examine de fa on critique les plans de la commission et ont tente d aboutir ce rapport en concertation avec toutes les parties impliquees comme il convient un parlement
french on demande aux entreprises de mettre en avant les points pratiques pouvant selon elles entraver le developpement du transport maritime courte distance
french nous attendons toujours ce compte rendu
french je voudrais souligner un certain nombre de points
french une fois de plus le transport maritime courte distance ne pourra tre fructueux en europe que s il est considere comme faisant partie integrante de la cha ne de transport
french dans ce cadre des liaisons avec l arri re pays sous la forme de transport ferroviaire sur les voies navigables interieures et par route constituent un element essentiel
french une integration avec les autres modes de transport est necessaire ce qui pose certaines exigences en mati re d infrastructure
french le transport maritime courte distance est egalement ideal pour le transport specialise par exemple de voitures
french l innovation dans la construction de bateaux specialises est ici d une importance capitale et peut constituer une impulsion pour notre construction navale
french l image du secteur est egalement importante et celle ci a clairement besoin d tre amelioree
french le secteur souffre du poids de la bureaucratie
french les procedures sont sans fin
french mais progressivement on observe egalement de nombreux points positifs dans le secteur
french les entreprises doivent prendre leurs responsabilites par exemple en creant des centres regionaux de promotion et de commercialisation mais le marche a besoin d tre soutenu
french les etats membres doivent supprimer les entraves
french je pense par exemple au monopole sur le transport par route avec toutes les consequences que cela entra ne pour les prix auxquels la navigation doit se ranger dans le port de transport maritime courte distance de bilbao
french nous rencontrons partout des procedures bureaucratiques d une longueur demesuree et une administration excessive pour accompagner la cargaison
french cela porte prejudice au transport maritime courte distance par rapport aux autres modes de transport
french le parlement demande de la flexibilite par rapport au secteur afin que celui ci puisse acquerir une meilleure position au niveau du prix
french nous pensons par exemple l affranchissement des services de lamanage dans les ports preuve de l experience des capitaines l appui
french une erreur particuli rement derangeante figure par ailleurs ce point dans l erratum il y est question de l experience des lamaneurs
french le terme lamaneurs doit bien evidemment tre remplace par le terme capitaines sinon cela n a aucun sens
french actuellement le marche est toujours fragmente
french c est pour cette raison que le parlement insiste dans son rapport sur la necessite de regrouper en un point l offre de services logistiques de transport faite aux utilisateurs finaux regroupement devant couvrir la mise disposition de transports multimodaux et corriger ainsi la fragmentation des services actuels
french dans mon rapport je plaide en outre en faveur de mesures de stimulation de la part de la commission des stimulants sont necessaires pour encourager le transport maritime courte distance
french en vue des liaisons europeennes j invite la commission mettre sur pied des programmes d investissement notamment dans le bassin mediterraneen et dans les ports de l adriatique
french le transport maritime courte distance a besoin de destinations
french avoir de magnifiques terminaux de transport courte distance rotterdam c est bien encore faut il pouvoir aller quelque part
french lors de l ebauche de nouvelles lignes une masse critique est necessaire et cela peut prendre un an ou deux
french l union europeenne devra contribuer surmonter ces difficultes avec des pr ts bon marche de la banque europeenne d investissement
french en outre nous ne disposons pas des donnees et statistiques sur lesquelles les entreprises peuvent baser leurs investissements
french tout le monde ignore ce que nous transportons de quelle mani re vers o et dans quelles quantites
french je pense que des statistiques relatives la nature et la destination des cargaisons constituent l un des elements dont nous avons besoin rapidement pour pouvoir mener une politique pour le transport qui augmentera les prochaines annees
french monsieur le president au nom de mes coll gues mm ripoll et perez alvarez qui ont travaille sur ce rapport mais qui ont d s absenter je voudrais feliciter le rapporteur mme peijs pour l excellent rapport qu elle a realise surtout parce qu il aborde un probl me important selon une approche tr s reelle et pratique
french je voudrais dire par ailleurs que je regrette present deux choses premi rement de ne pas pouvoir conna tre l avis de notre ami fatuzzo sur la fa on dont le transport maritime courte distance influence les inter ts des retraites europeens et deuxi mement qu il y ait si peu de deputes car en reflechissant aux inter ts ego stes de cette assemblee il est probable qu un jour ils regrettent de ne pas avoir pris connaissance du probl me du transport maritime courte distance car peut tre devrons nous l utiliser un jour pour nos allees et venues strasbourg
french pour entrer dans le vif du sujet il faut dire mme peijs que nous avons suivi avec grand inter t les actions et developpements qui ces derni res annees en particulier la suite de la constitution du forum des industries maritimes ont ete menees au sein de l union europeenne en vue de la promotion du transport maritime courte distance en tant qu alternative au transport terrestre
french le rapport de la commission et le rapport du rapporteur mettent en relief differents avantages comparatifs entre les deux types de transport parmi lesquels je soulignerais s agissant du transport maritime la baisse de la saturation des infrastructures leur moindre co t la reduction de leur consommation energetique ce qui implique une reduction des emissions de polluants dans et l amelioration des communications avec les regions peripheriques de l union europeenne
french nous estimons et je pense que nous sommes tous d accord sur ce point que le transfert des charges du mode de transport terrestre au maritime devrait tre considere comme un objectif prioritaire des politiques de transport de l union europeenne
french je voudrais souligner qu une serie d actions prises ces deux derni res annees ont eu des retombees positives sur le transport maritime courte distance
french comme le signale le rapport de la commission entre et cela a permis l activite du transport maritime intracommunautaire de cro tre de
french neanmoins son taux de croissance est objectivement modeste le taux de croissance annuel cumule n atteint que et inferieur celui que conna t le transport terrestre savoir
french par consequent au lieu d un rapprochement de ces positions relatives entre le transport maritime et terrestre la difference entre les deux a continue d augmenter
french tout indique donc qu il faut prendre des mesures quantitatives plus energiques et probablement envisager le probl me sous un angle qualitatif different
french le rapport de mme peijs nous semble tr s equilibre mais nous voudrions attirer l attention sur un des objectifs cles pour la promotion du transport maritime courte distance la reduction simultanee du temps et du co t direct des operations portuaires des navires qui fournissent ce type de services
french dans bien des cas les services portuaires concernant le navire et les marchandises sont fournis sans concurrence reelle ou avec une concurrence tr s limitee ce qui entra ne souvent des abus de position dominante comme l imposition de services obligatoires inutiles et m me inutilises comme par exemple le pilotage le remorquage l amarrage ou la manutention portuaire ainsi que le paiement de tarifs tr s eleves
french en tout cas part quelques rares exceptions les services maritimes transoceaniques ne sont pas confrontes la concurrence de la route et dans la plupart des cas le transport aerien ne represente pas non plus un concurrent reel
french d s lors nous pensons que si nous voulons promouvoir le transport maritime courte distance de mani re realiste et efficace il est indispensable de maintenir le type actuel de fourniture de services portuaires en ameliorant leur efficacite et en reduisant leurs co ts
french il ne faut pas non plus oublier leur importance pour l economie des regions o il existe une industrie de construction navale
french cela suppose une revitalisation de toute la region comme le savent tr s bien ceux qui vivent dans ces villes dans ces regions o l industrie navale constitue un element tr s actif de l economie locale
french monsieur le president monsieur le commissaire chers coll gues la question m a ete posee pourquoi nous engageons nous de la sorte sur le plan europeen pour le transport maritime courte distance
french la reponse est nous avons une vision
french de grandes quantites de marchandises seront transportees travers notre continent sur des navires s rs et moins polluants
french les marchandises seront dechargees l o elles atteindront leur destination par la voie terrestre la plus courte
french le trafic terrestre sera ainsi decharge car un autre maillon de la cha ne de transport intermodale sera complete
french nous sommes des milles marins d une telle realite m me si comme le montre le rapport certaines choses ont ete accomplies au cours de ces deux derni res annees
french le bon rapport de mme peijs thematise les obstacles actuels et les strategies en vue de la concretisation de nos visions
french un grand consensus a ete obtenu au sein de la commission
french que pouvons nous faire sur le plan interne pour le transport maritime courte distance
french je dirai simplement que sur le plan technique il faut introduire des moteurs moins polluants et des terminaux specifiques pour le transbordement express
french sur le plan organisationnel avant toute chose dans le cadre des transports transfrontaliers nous avons besoin de papiers de transport uniformes de procedures administratives simplifiees et moins de services de lamanage l o cela n est pas absolument necessaire
french que pouvons nous faire pour le transport maritime courte distance en tant que maillon de la cha ne intermodale
french tout d abord ameliorer les interfaces vers les autres moyens de transport l aide de dispositifs de transbordement modernes en particulier pour la navigation interieure simplifier les conteneurs promouvoir des services logistiques pour l ensemble de la cha ne des transports et bien plus encore que ce qui ne figure dans le rapport
french je pense que nous devrions envisager toutes ces considerations dans le cadre de nos strategies de preadhesion
french des tables rondes fonctionnent entre temps
french l echange des meilleures pratiques serait judicieux nous dit le rapport
french c est exact car quelle fin soutenons nous depuis un certain temps un centre de reference pour le transport intermodal
french il serait judicieux d engager plus de recherches et avant tout de creer des projets de demonstration dans le domaine intermodal
french dans l ensemble le rapport offre tout un ensemble de conseils judicieux
french j esp re que le prochain rapport d avancement nous confirmera dans deux ans que nous nous sommes approches de notre vision d un syst me de transport intermodal fructueux en europe
french monsieur le president j aimerais revenir sur trois aspects de l excellent rapport de mme peijs et les illustrer par des exemples
french bien que ces exemples soient tires de ma propre circonscription je les sais representatifs de nombreuses regions semblables
french j aimerais tout d abord aborder l intermodalite et le besoin d optimiser l infrastructure de liaison l arri re pays
french cette semaine nous avons vote en faveur de mesures respectueuses de l environnement et creees afin d encourager le developpement du transport de fret par voie de chemin de fer
french dans ce contexte un acc s aise du chemin de fer dans les ports est tout fait primordial
french nous devons cependant accepter que c est parfois le reseau routier qui constitue le meilleur acc s l arri re pays
french je cite en exemple l integration dans le reseau rte de la a reliant graina stranraer vu son importance pour le transport maritime de et vers l irlande du nord
french citons comme second point l important degre de dependance des regions eloignees et des les par rapport la mer pour etablir des contacts avec leurs voisins
french nous considerons trop souvent la mer comme une etendue qui separe les communautes alors que nous ferions mieux d y voir une autoroute permettant de les relier
french d s lors mon groupe soutient les amendements et
french j aimerais cependant ajouter qu il serait souhaitable pour des raisons de durabilite ecologique de considerer de la m me mani re les connexions entre les peninsules
french l ouest de l ecosse la distance separant gourock de dunoon est vingt fois plus longue par voie de terre que par voie de mer et celle reliant tarbert portavadie l est fois
french troisi mement il est essentiel de continuer considerer certaines voies maritimes courtes comme des lignes de vie
french et je ne parle pas uniquement ici du besoin de maintenir les obligations de services publics dans ce contexte
french nous devons aussi trouver d autres moyens de reduire les co ts des transports vers les les et les communautes eloignees
french leur economie est tr s fragile et il est tout simplement inacceptable que les agriculteurs de l le de lewis payent leur foin deux fois plus cher que ceux qui habitent pr s d inverness
french j esp re que la commission prendra serieusement ces points en consideration lorsqu elle developpera une politique dans ce domaine
french monsieur le president dans ce groupe nous accueillons favorablement le rapport de mme peijs et la position de la commission laquelle il repond
french il est vrai en effet que le transport maritime courte distance est respectueux de l environnement et qu il reste rentable et il est vrai egalement que ce type de transport favorise le developpement economique des regions c ti res mais en ecosse nous faisons appel la commission afin qu elle fasse un effort en ce qui concerne la liberalisation venir du transport maritime dans l ouest de l ecosse
french comme mme attwool vient de le mentionner il existe dans cette region en plus du transport de et vers les les un important reseau de liaisons maritimes courte distance entre ce que nous appelons des lochs de mer et que les geologues appellent des fjords c est dire qu au lieu de parcourir kilom tres sur une route de montagne sinueuse vous prenez un bateau pour une courte traversee
french si nous cherchions une interpretation sensee du r glement sur le cabotage nous dirions bien s r ces peninsules sont equivalentes des les d un point de vue fonctionnel et les obligations de services publics s y appliquent de la m me mani re
french dans ce cas l etat pourrait legalement subventionner les services
french de m me on pourrait considerer de mani re globale toutes ces routes qui sillonnent l ouest de l ecosse plut t que de les diviser et d encourager ainsi une selection par les chefs d entreprises privees qui empruntent les quelques routes payantes et rendent ainsi plus difficile l entretien des routes qui ne sont pas rentables toute l annee
french nous voulons une vue globale de ce type de probl me en europe et nous souhaitons que la commission en fasse une approche imaginative
french cela fait maintenant six semaines que j ai pose la commission la question de savoir si elle accepterait de considerer les peninsules de la m me mani re que les les
french auparavant les membres de la commission avaient declare tr s bien conna tre l ouest de l ecosse
french nous n avons encore re u aucune reponse cette question
french je demande qu on y reponde de toute urgence
french monsieur le president madame le rapporteur mesdames et messieurs l avis formule par la commission en mati re de developpement du transport maritime courte distance en europe et le tr s bon rapport y afferent de notre coll gue peijs nous donnent une image realiste de l evolution de ce type de transport non polluant au cours de ces deux derni res annees en europe
french le developpement et la promotion du transport maritime courte distance en particulier ont permis d accomplir un pas important en vue du developpement d un syst me de transport multimodal pour l union europeenne et les regions avoisinantes
french efficacite rentabilite respect de l environnement et durabilite caracterisent ce mode de transport face au transport routier et peuvent offrir une alternative notable dans les regions c ti res
french il convient toutefois aussi de renforcer l interaction des divers modes de transport afin de faire valoir au mieux leurs atouts specifiques respectifs
french c est pourquoi plusieurs mesures de promotion europeennes nationales et regionales publiques et privees sont necessaires en vue d adapter et de developper les ports qui constituent le point nevralgique au sein de la cha ne des transports et ce de mani re ciblee en fonction des exigences specifiques
french il convient en outre d adapter les elements techniques et organisationnels connexes tels que formalites administratives et documents procedures douani res et de chargement de mani re permettre un passage rapide et fluide d un type de transport un autre et d un pays un autre
french des incitants particuliers pour le developpement de technologies innovatrices des terminaux de dedouanement specifiques pour le transport maritime courte distance et l integration des ports dans la strategie de developpement des regions c ti res seraient des moyens de soutien supplementaires
french c est essentiel pour renforcer la cohesion economique et sociale et le lien entre les regions centrales et peripheriques au sein de l union europeenne
french la collaboration economique croissante entre l ue et ses pays voisins le besoin de transport croissant qui en decoule peuvent tre concretises efficacement par le biais de l integration du transport maritime courte distance dans la cha ne logistique de la livraison porte porte
french monsieur le president au nom de mon coll gue rijk van dam je voudrais dire ce qui suit
french la politique de transport exige des choix
french une politique de transport durable exige encore plus ou en tout cas d autres choix
french faciliter les flux de marchandises et de personnes tout en evitant autant que possible les consequences negatives telle est la t che que nous devons accomplir ici
french le moyen de transport dont il est question ici le transport maritime courte distance a la reputation d tre une forme de transport constituant plus d un point de vue une solution aux consequences negatives savoir la prise de place et le caract re nefaste pour l environnement auxquelles nous confronte le secteur du transport
french cependant comme l a signale tout fait pertinemment mme peijs le secteur n utilise actuellement pas ces possibilites de fa on optimale
french je voudrais mettre l accent sur certains points
french nous entendons frequemment que le transport maritime courte distance et le transport nautique en general est un mode de transport ecologique pour ce qui est des emissions par unite transportee
french d un point de vue relatif cela est certainement vrai
french toutefois les progr s realises dans ce domaine dans d autres secteurs notamment le transport par route ebranlent cette position
french des interventions rapides seraient donc necessaires au niveau de la navigation
french vu les evolutions dans le secteur du transport par route la suite des nouvelles normes europeennes en mati re d emissions de carburants je pense qu une amelioration de la prestation ecologique du transport maritime courte distance a besoin d tre stimulee au moyen d une directive europeenne concernant les emissions maximales autorisees des moteurs de bateaux
french je pense de plus contrairement certains coll gues que le transport maritime courte distance ne devrait pas seulement servir de complement aux modes de transport existants mais egalement constituer une alternative pour les transports intra communautaires
french vu la problematique de la division voire la reduction des points eco en autriche un itineraire alternatif du nord au sud et vice versa serait le bienvenu
french une partie pourrait en tout cas tre reprise par le transport maritime courte distance
french un troisi me point concerne ce qui se passe dans les ports
french si le transport maritime courte distance souhaite egalement tre plus competitif sur le plan de la vitesse des mesures sur le plan des douanes et des activites de chargement et dechargement sont necessaires comme le signale pertinemment le rapporteur
french si le secteur fonctionne mieux et de fa on plus moderne les possibilites devront egalement tre connues
french dans un certain nombre de pays dont les pays bas des agences de renseignements ont ete creees dans ce but et avec succ s
french il est d s lors recommande aux autorites nationales comme regionales de contribuer de cette mani re l essor de ce secteur
french en bref le rapport de mme peijs est tr s complet et je l en complimente sinc rement
french lorsque les parties impliquees prendront leurs responsabilites on ne pourra que conclure ce que l on sait dej aux pays bas le transport sur l eau la meilleure voie
french monsieur le president pour le visiteur venu de loin la traversee vers les les ecossaises est un moment romantique et il est vrai que la beaute ne manque jamais d emouvoir les ecossais autant que les visiteurs
french mais pour ceux qui vivent sur ces les et qui y gagnent leur vie les services maritimes insulaires representent la fois un besoin vital et un obstacle surmonter pour leur bien tre economique et social
french les co ts surmonter ne se limitent pas aux prix de la traversee m me si ceux ci representent souvent une difficulte il faut aussi tenir compte de la difficulte des pre reservations des files d attente de l adaptation des horaires variables et des traversees peu frequentes et du risque de retard ou d annulation suite des probl mes techniques une meteo capricieuse ou encore des gr ves qui prennent parfois l le en otage
french en ce moment la politique de concurrence de l union europeenne qui implique que ces services fassent l objet d adjudications concurrentielles inqui te beaucoup les ecossais car elle minera ces services vitaux m me leur niveau actuel et augmentera encore le co t de la vie et la difficulte de faire des affaires
french nous devons rassurer ceux qui vivent et travaillent sur ces les vulnerables et ces peninsules reculees et leur confirmer qu ils n ont rien craindre de l introduction d un aspect concurrentiel dans le processus d adjudication de ces contrats
french puis je demander la commission de faire tout ce qui est en son pouvoir pour rassurer les ecossais l executif ecossais qui tente en ce moment de faire face cette situation et le parlement ecossais en leur confirmant qu elle fera en sorte que ce processus fonctionne bien et que loin de nuire aux services maritimes des les ecossaises il leur sera benefique
french peut tre puis je demander au commissaire verheugen de transmettre une invitation mme le commissaire des transports sa coll gue mme de palacio m accompagner pour une traversee romantique vers les les ecossaises
french monsieur le president monsieur le commissaire chers coll gues vivant dans un pays qui poss de un immense littoral et de tr s nombreuses les vivant m me dans une le je connais de premi re main la valeur des transports maritimes courte distance
french bien entendu le principal domaine est celui du transport des passagers cependant le rapport l examen se focalise sur le transport des marchandises en reponse la communication de la commission sur cette question
french il vaut la peine de noter que malgre l augmentation du volume des transports de ce type au cours des derni res annees les transports routiers s accroissent plus qu eux cela signifie qu il faudra accorder une importance particuli re aux transports maritimes plus respectueux de l environnement
french l image actuelle que l on en provoque presque la repulsion chez le client qui a le sentiment d un moyen de transport assez vetuste lent et complique
french des entraves supplementaires font aussi obstacle au developpement de ces moyens de transport les procedures administratives qui pourraient tre ameliorees mais aussi les retards les infrastructures incompl tes et les taxes non transparentes dans certains ports ainsi que les charges de mouillage qui pourraient tre evitees
french neanmoins il est possible d ameliorer cette image afin qu ils constituent une solution alternative viable pour les marchandises pouvant tre transportees de diverses mani res
french je parle bien entendu des lieux qui sont lies aux transports maritimes comme les les auxquelles il faut toujours porter une attention particuli re
french le r le du secteur prive est certes fondamental mais il existe des aspects du fonctionnement du marche qui exigent une intervention des organes de l etat au niveau regional national et europeen exigeant m me une contribution economique afin que les insulaires ne se sentent pas appartenir une seconde classe d europeens
french le developpement du cabotage a une repercussion immediate sur le developpement social et economique de nos regions et par consequent sur la cohesion de l union europeenne
french c est de toute evidence dans cet esprit que le rapporteur a considere son sujet et elle s en est occupee avec le plus grand serieux je lui dois donc en tant qu insulaire des remerciements particuliers
french nous remercions egalement le commissaire verheugen qui comme je le vois a mis ses ecouteurs de l attention qu il a accordee il y a un moment aux explications du vote des coll gues
french monsieur le president chers coll gues monsieur le commissaire l heure o nous tentons de corriger des disparites regionales le rapport de mme peijs qui traite du probl me des transports maritime courte distance et invite les etats membres et la commission adopter des mesures afin de promouvoir ce type de transport s av re tr s opportun
french comme toujours je me permets de rappeler que la politique regionale et structurelle de l union constitue principalement une reponse aux contraintes specifiques que connaissent certaines regions europeennes comme celles dites ultraperipheriques
french la commission a presente en mars dernier un rapport etablissant une strategie en vue de leur developpement durable et comportant plusieurs aspects principaux parmi lesquels il faut souligner les relations desdites regions avec leur environnement geographique qui dans une certaine mesure conditionne considerablement leur developpement
french nous estimons donc que le rapport de mme peijs est pertinent surtout si on le renforce en approuvant l amendement que j ai depose au sujet de l inclusion du transport maritime entre les ports situes sur les territoires des regions ultraperipheriques et des pays de leur environnement geographique
french nous pourrions ainsi corriger l erreur commise par la commission lorsqu elle a elabore le rapport bisannuel sur le developpement de ce type de transport en partant d une definition incompl te du transport maritime courte distance
french monsieur le president monsieur le commissaire chers coll gues le transport maritime courte distance est bien le mode de transport le plus economique efficace et approprie pour les regions reculees
french je remercie mme peijs pour sa presentation interessante
french dans mon pays le transport maritime consiste presque enti rement en ce transport maritime courte distance il est donc important pour nous
french nous formons un cas d exception aussi parce que notre seule liaison terrestre avec le reste de l ue se trouve dans le nord et de ce fait l importance des transports maritimes est considerable
french enfin l ecartement de nos voies ferrees diff re de celui du reste de l union europeenne
french le plus singulier est pourtant le fait que dans mon pays les transports maritimes s arr tent toujours en hiver si l on ne prend pas de mesures car la mer g le
french pour cette raison nous avons d creer une flotte particuli re pour briser la glace
french ce sont des navires forts dont l energie correspond celle utilisee par une ville
french de ce fait puisque nous avons ce handicap de deplacement nous souhaitons qu on puisse subventionner ce brisement des glaces car nous n y pouvons rien c est un obstacle voulu par le createur
french il est egalement deplorable que l impact social et l impact sur l emploi de ce trafic ne sont pas suffisamment releves
french la main x uvre bon marche constitue un risque enorme dans ces conditions donc surtout au nord quand la mer est gelee
french comment une personne portant d habitude des shorts presque totalement depourvue de competences professionnelles peut elle se debrouiller par trente degres sous zero avec trois m tres de glace
french c est un probl me
french le personnel aerien est toujours bien forme mais on ne peut pas dire de m me de cette main x uvre bon marche qui travaille sur les navires
french j attends donc que la commission intervienne dans cette affaire
french monsieur le president je voudrais moi aussi feliciter mme peijs pour son excellent rapport
french il y a beaucoup de probl mes et de goulets d etranglement dans le trafic europeen les routes et l espace aerien sont encombres et la competitivite des chemins de fer est mauvaise
french cette semaine il y a eu ici au parlement plusieurs rapports importants concernant les transports et qui visent tous desencombrer les embouteillages et diminuer les goulets d etranglement du trafic
french l excellent rapport de mme peijs vise exploiter les possibilites du transport maritime courte distance
french c est un complement important aux rapports concernant les transports ferroviaires et aeriens
french nous avons vraiment besoin des cha nes logistiques competitives qui regroupent le trafic routier les transports ferroviaires les transports maritimes courte distance ainsi que l informatique moderne
french pour les pays d outre mer eloignes dont fait aussi partie la finlande le transport maritime courte distance est une question vitale comme le vient de prouver m paasilinna
french je voudrais souligner la disponibilite et l opportunite des ports et des services portuaires
french il faudra englober les ports dans des reseaux aux dimensions europeennes en tant que parties de la structure de base du trafic
french la mise en x uvre des mesures proposees dans le rapport suppose une bonne cooperation entre l union les etats membres les collectivites locales et aussi les entreprises ainsi que des efforts reels en faveur du transport maritime courte distance
french monsieur le president je voudrais tout d abord feliciter le rapporteur pour son excellent rapport
french il est tr s clair qu elle a passe beaucoup de temps le rediger et elle y a souligne de nombreux probl mes
french nous pouvons tr s clairement observer les differents probl mes des diverses regions de l union europeenne
french chaque region a ses propres probl mes
french il nous faut reconna tre qu il nous faudra du temps pour atteindre notre objectif final
french mais il ne fait aucun doute que nous devons faire plus d efforts que nous ne l avons fait jusqu ce jour afin d ameliorer le transport maritime courte distance
french il est certes tr s sense de transporter plus de marchandises par voie maritime que par la route
french le transport maritime est plus respectueux de l environnement et plus acceptable tous points de vue
french mais nous devons nous assurer du respect de l equilibre
french c est ce que le rapporteur a tente de souligner
french un des probl mes principaux restera le facteur co t
french pour tre competitifs les ports doivent tre plus efficaces et pour ce faire ils auront certainement besoin de plus de soutien
french je soutiens la demande de mme attwool concernant la a
french elle reconna t qu en irlande nous exportons des marchandises via une portion de mer tr s ch re reliant l irlande du nord et l ecosse
french c est le canal de distribution principal pour tout ce que nous produisons
french de l ecosse les marchandises sont ensuite acheminees vers l angleterre
french il doit certainement exister un moyen de transport plus efficace et plus respectueux de l environnement mais il n existe pas de moyen meilleur marche
french si nous voulons que notre industrie et notre agriculture survivent elles doivent rester abordables
french nous disposions d un service de ferry tr s efficace reliant ballycastle au sud de l ecosse mais nous avons ete dans l obligation de le fermer pour des raisons de manque de soutien et de bureaucratie
french monsieur le president madame le rapporteur je voudrais d abord feliciter le rapporteur pour la qualite de son rapport
french tous les coll gues qui sont intervenus l ont dit et comme vous ont regrette que le transport maritime courte distance souffre d une mauvaise image de marque eu egard sa lenteur ou son inefficacite alors qu il offre une reponse la congestion du trafic au co t eleve des infrastructures et au co t environnemental
french d ailleurs ce transport a connu ces derni res annees un succ s indeniable m me s il est encore insuffisant et mal connu
french pourtant il presente vous l avez dit des avantages en termes de co ts d energie d efficacite de cohesion regionale d environnement et m me d intermodalite car c est un moyen ideal dans la mise en x uvre des transports multimodaux
french des mesures doivent donc tre prises rapidement pour renforcer l efficacite des operations portuaires et reduire les temps d attente dans les ports
french personnellement j insiste pour que la puissance publique joue son r le tant au niveau regional que national et europeen
french deux points cependant de votre rapport me posent probl me
french il y a d abord la proposition qui vise etablir une liste des ports particuli rement adaptes au transport maritime courte distance
french cette liste ne me para t pas necessaire car elle comporte le risque de penaliser les ports qui ne sont pas aujourd hui tout fait adaptes mais qui vont se transformer pour l avenir
french par ailleurs il est suggere de regrouper en un seul point l offre des services logistiques de transport faite aux utilisateurs
french je suis pour un syst me d information mais je refuse personnellement qu un grand port dej en position de force centralise la totalite des services
french j aurais enfin aime en tant que membre de la commission de l industrie qu on dise clairement que le transport maritime courte distance ne doit pas tre considere comme une alternative mais qu il faudrait une strategie intermodale etablissant une complementarite entre les modes de transport
french dans ce cadre et dans cet esprit les etats membres devraient d ailleurs harmoniser leur reglementation en particulier pour le transport terrestre qui provoque souvent en termes de distorsions des ruptures de continuite
french il est important si on veut avoir un syst me multimodal de disposer d un ensemble de moyens de transport et de r gles qui soient sinon communes du moins parfaitement harmonisees
french monsieur le president permettez moi de remercier mme peijs pour son excellent rapport et pour le travail qu elle a fourni
french le rapport demontre que le transport maritime courte distance est un point sur lequel un large accord existe entre vous les etats membres et la commission la commission et cet accord vont plus loin
french je ne connais personne ni aucune organisation qui ne souhaite pas voir se developper le transport maritime courte distance
french dans le passe nous avons commis l erreur de denigrer le transport maritime courte distance
french nous parlions de son potentiel et sous entendions donc que ce secteur ne se portait pas bien
french mais il se porte bien
french m me si on en a tr s peu parle le transport maritime courte distance est le moyen de transport qui dans les annees quatre vingt dix a le mieux resiste au developpement du transport routier
french nous devons donc reconna tre les merites du transport maritime courte distance
french cependant on peut toujours mieux faire et l industrie maritime est la premi re le reconna tre
french permettez moi de mentionner quelques points cles du rapport de mme peijs
french il nous faut une approche globale pour un concept de service porte porte veritable
french il doit tre pleinement integre dans la cha ne de transport et tre propose par des guichets uniques
french plusieurs goulots d etranglement entravent le developpement du transport maritime courte distance
french les services de la commission ainsi que les nouveaux etats membres et le secteur de l industrie s emploient en ce moment les identifier et leur trouver des solutions potentielles
french un point dej identifie est la diversite des documents requis pour le transport maritime courte distance
french dans un souci d uniformite la commission a l intention de presenter d ici la fin de l annee une proposition visant harmoniser certains documents necessaires au depart et l arrivee de certains bateaux
french l efficacite des ports est essentielle pour le transport maritime courte distance c est pourquoi la commission presentera egalement d ici la fin de l annee un ensemble de mesures visant augmenter leur efficacite par la liberalisation
french de plus il est necessaire de renouveler l image demodee du transport maritime courte distance ce qui ma grande satisfaction a dej ete mentionne au cours du debat
french les offices nationaux de promotion du transport maritime courte distance doivent jouer un r le essentiel dans la mise en x uvre de cette politique
french certains offices de promotion existent dej et la commission encourage en etablir d autres afin de creer un reseau europeen de promotion
french au cours du debat la question de l octroi de subventions communautaires a ete levee j aimerais repondre cette question
french le programme pact c est dire un programme d actions pilotes en faveur du transport combine a constitue de par le passe la principale source de subventions communautaires consacrees au transport maritime courte distance
french l annee derni re du budget du programme pact soit millions d euros ont ete alloues pour promouvoir le transport maritime combine courte distance
french ce montant sera encore plus eleve en pour atteindre du budget total du programme pact
french la dg responsable souhaite continuer sur cette voie afin qu une bonne partie du budget du programme pact soit de nouveau allouee au transport maritime courte distance
french il se pourrait m me que ce principe fasse partie integrante du texte legal lors de la revision prochaine du pact
french m purvis m a demande de transmettre une invitation ma coll gue mme de palacio
french je n y manquerai pas et je suis certain que mme de palacio appreciera cette croisi re romantique en ecosse
french je pense m me que la traversee n en serait que plus romantique si vous m invitiez l accompagner
french mme peijs je vous remercie pour votre travail
french merci de vous tre assuree que nous avancions tous dans la m me direction
french joignons nos forces dans cet effort je peux vous assurer que la commission fera de son mieux
french monsieur le president permettez moi d exprimer mon mecontentement en effet je n ai obtenu aucun accuse de reception encore moins de reponse de la part de la commission sur un sujet pour lequel je lui ai pourtant adresse une question par ecrit il y a plus de six semaines et que j ai egalement aborde au cours du debat
french merci beaucoup monsieur maccormick
french le vote aura lieu demain heures
french dialogue civil
french l ordre du jour appelle la question orale la commission b au nom de la commission de l emploi et des affaires sociales sur le financement futur du dialogue civil
french la parole est m pronk
french monsieur le president je n ose esperer qu il nous reste beaucoup de temps cette heure avancee
french il est dommage de devoir cl turer maintenant un debat pourtant important en soi
french si je peux me permettre d abuser de cette occasion je pense qu il serait peut tre intelligent si l avenir nous ne votons pas le mardi d instaurer un tour de vote supplementaire le mardi soir afin de ne pas accumuler plus de retard pendant la semaine
french peut tre pourriez vous le proposer une fois de plus au bureau pour qu il consid re la chose
french mais cela n a bien s r pas grand chose voir avec ces questions
french je n ai pas besoin d en dire trop ce sujet
french tout d abord l importance exceptionnelle du r le joue par les organisations non gouvernementales aussi bien au niveau des etats membres qu au niveau de l union europeenne et qu en dehors de l union europeenne est incontestable
french tout le monde est d accord sur ce point le conseil l a dit la commission l a souvent rappele de m me que ce parlement
french il est egalement vrai que l article du traite europeen si vous l associez aux declarations et souligne la necessite d une collaboration avec notamment les associations de solidarite qui sont naturellement aussi des organisations non gouvernementales
french le parlement europeen l a toujours mis en pratique et a ainsi cree il y a un certain temps il y a assez longtemps une ligne budgetaire b afin de permettre le financement des organisations non gouvernementales
french seulement la suite des differentes dispositions prises en accord avec le conseil et la suite des arr ts de la cour de justice cette ligne a plus ou moins disparu apr s trois ans
french cela fait dej trois ans que la commission europeenne est au courant que tel serait le cas
french l n est pas le probl me
french le probl me est seulement le manque de mouvement
french d une part nous constatons l importance notable d autre part nous notons qu il y a assez peu d actions concr tes l exception du texte publie par la commission sur lequel porte en particulier notre demande d information
french le tout est de voir present comment nous pouvons concretiser les belles idees que nous avons tous exprimees
french c est ici qu apparaissent souvent et je ne parle pas au nom de la commission mais en mon nom certains probl mes bureaucratiques
french cela est peut tre d au fait que differentes directions de la commission sont impliquees
french les ong ne sont pas limitees une direction generale
french il est possible que l on recherche une sorte de point de vue general et que l on souhaite en m me temps avoir egalement des points de vue specifiques mais tout cela prend en tout cas trop de temps car les lignes budgetaires expirent prochainement
french c est egalement la raison pour laquelle nous demandons ce soir cette heure inadequate en soi l attention de la commission pour cette problematique
french il s agit particuli rement d une question de rapidite
french il ne s agit pas ici de l intention de la commission mais de la rapidite avec laquelle tout cela peut tre realise
french sinon nous courrons le risque de ne pouvoir mettre en x uvre une t che essentielle que nous attribue le traite europeen dans des declarations mais egalement ce que nous a dit le conseil europeen feira car les ong c est l que se situe le probl me sont extr mement sensibles du moins pour la plupart aux interruptions des paiements qui leur sont accordes
french elles y sont bien plus sensibles que d autres organisations et surtout que les etats membres
french cela signifie que si l on attend trop longtemps le patient sera decede
french c est ce que craint notre commission
french c est la raison pour laquelle nous posons ces questions et c est egalement la raison pour laquelle nous esperons que la commission reagira rapidement dans les limites des possibilites offertes par le traite et dans les limites du climat general de bienveillance dont le conseil a fait preuve feira que le parlement a vu et que la commission a demontre
french monsieur le president je peux tre exceptionnellement bref
french je pense que la reponse du commissaire etait en soi encourageante
french je trouve en effet que pour ce qui est du parlement nous devons faire tout notre possible pour ne pas laisser des procedures entraver la bonne marche de tout ceci
french je dois bien dire que avec toutes les possibilites dont nous disposions notamment sur le plan financier nous avons fait de notre mieux pour maintenir les lignes budgetaires permettant de continuer financer les ong
french seulement un certain moment cela ne marche plus et la rapidite devient alors primordiale
french un dernier point propos de la reponse officielle du commissaire sur la conference intergouvernementale
french il ne s agit pas tant en fait du contenu du traite actuel ou des declarations actuelles pour lui il s agit en fait uniquement de modifier ces declarations de sorte constituer une base juridique pouvant servir de base pour un programme
french c est l que se situe le probl me et je voudrais demander au commissaire s il est possible d y accorder de l attention au sein de la commission
french nous ne demandons donc pas un nouveau traite mais de l attention
french enfin vu que dans le cadre de l elargissement nous avons naturellement encore beaucoup faire avec le developpement des ong dans les nouveaux etats membres nous estimons qu il faut leur accorder une priorite particuli re
french monsieur le president j interviens au nom du groupe socialiste pour soutenir ce qu a dit m pronk au nom de l ensemble de la commission
french je dois dire me referant aux reponses du commissaire qu elles ne m ont pas du tout satisfaite dans le sens o nous connaissons les documents vises et o comme le disait m pronk il nous faut faire preuve de celerite et de decision
french nous savons qu un dialogue existe depuis des annees
french en tant que parlement nous avons joue un r le fondamental toutefois il faut passer de la parole aux actes
french je crois que la commission doit proposer des solutions concr tes parce que sinon ce probl me ne se resoudra pas
french je dec le egalement une certaine contradiction et j eprouve quelque inquietude que je crois partagee par la commission de l emploi et des affaires sociales parce qu il me semble que les actes de la commission sont quelque peu contradictoires
french les organisations non gouvernementales et le r le economique et social qu elles jouent dans le processus de construction democratique de l union et tout le secteur de l economie sociale sont desormais reconnus non seulement dans les textes mais aussi dans la realite concr te si on consid re qu environ neuf millions de personnes travaillent dans ce secteur comme un secteur essentiel et important
french eh bien dans ses derniers choix la commission je pense la direction generale industrie estime que c est une priorite negative voil maintenant qu ils inventent les priorites positives et negatives et a supprime l unite economie sociale
french je crois que c est tr s grave et cela nous fait penser que les declarations qui sont reaffirmees ici et que nous avons entendues plusieurs reprises deboucheront sur des actes concrets dans la mauvaise direction
french la plate forme des ong l instrument par lequel la commission et le parlement ont maintenu le dialogue tout ce petit monde se sent un peu devalorise nous m mes nous sentons un peu humilies quand les declarations vont dans un sens et les decisions concr tes dans l autre
french l absence d interlocuteur rendra du point de vue fonctionnel egalement plus difficile la resolution de ces probl mes au lieu de la faciliter
french si nous voulons vraiment les affronter dans un esprit positif accelerer les procedures et donner des reponses positives non seulement aux organisations non gouvernementales mais aussi aux citoyens europeens il faudra revoir toute une serie de decisions et surtout en modifier certaines
french monsieur le president plusieurs membres du groupe des verts et de l alliance libre europeenne ont fait partie d on et du mouvement activiste et ce sujet nous tient donc particuli rement c x ur
french nous avons aborde aujourd hui le rapport annuel de la commission des petitions savoir les plaintes relatives au processus d evaluation des evenements qui se deroulent au sein de l union europeenne
french selon nous les ong font partie integrante du processus de prevention
french elles fournissent un mecanisme d observation ainsi qu un moyen de nous assurer que nous ne perdons pas de vue les aspects de la legislation que nous mettons en place
french elles nous donnent de nouvelles idees et sont essentielles dans notre processus
french les ong font partie de ces quelques organisations reellement actives au nom du citoyen et si nous essayons d installer la confiance au sein des structures que nous mettons en place leur r le est tout fait crucial
french leur presence est primordiale pour contrebalancer de nombreux inter ts purement financiers qui ne semblent avoir aucun mal se frayer un chemin jusqu nos portes alors que les activites internationales des ong ont un co t tr s eleve
french le travail que nous avons fourni au sein des diverses commissions au cours des derni res semaines concernant l article relatif la non discrimination n aurait pas ete possible sans l apport de ces organismes
french il est donc tr s important de decider d une base legale claire pour leur participation et donc leur financement car cette assemblee ne peut pas fonctionner correctement sans eux
french il a ete fait reference aux pays candidats et je me ferai ici l echo de mon coll gue m pronk qui affirme que les ong et le mouvement de la societe civile vont tre essentiels dans ces pays si nous voulons une union europeenne basee sur des valeurs telles que la justice et la democratie
french j aimerais insister sur la necessite de trouver un moyen d etablir un mecanisme de financement serieux et stable pour ces organisations qui representent les pauvres les exclus et les personnes victimes de discrimination afin de pouvoir au moins leur eviter de devoir grappiller des fonds chaque annee et de se demander si elles vont survivre pour mener bien les t ches pour lesquelles elles ont ete creees
french monsieur le president au cours de ces derni res annees l ue a obtenu plusieurs competences importantes dans le domaine social mais l ue n a pas vraiment re u beaucoup d argent pour resoudre le probl me social
french tant que les etats membres penseront que les questions sociales rel vent au fond de leur propre competence nous n assisterons pas un changement rapide
french nous savons que les ressources existantes sont fortement budgetisees et qu il est difficile de deplacer les ressources dans le budget
french il sera difficile de satisfaire de nouveaux besoins aussi longtemps que l avis appartiendra aux etats membres
french c est la raison pour laquelle je pense qu il est absolument essentiel pour nous qui travaillons dans les institutions de l ue de veiller donner aux organisations democratiques benevoles d europe qui x uvrent dans le domaine social plus de poids qu l heure actuelle
french nous pouvons tous constater que des activites transfrontali res sont egalement necessaires dans le domaine social
french il y a donc une place pour les organisations benevoles
french il serait toutefois malheureux et peut tre est ce ainsi que les etats membres le voient que les organisations sociales benevoles soient etroitement liees economiquement et politiquement l ue plus qu elles ne le sont dej
french leur force reside justement dans le fait qu elles sont benevoles et civiles et peuvent envisager les probl mes sociaux d une perpective autre que celle des autorites et constituer d s lors un complement une alternative la commission au conseil et au parlement
french je voudrais en profiter malgre le peu de gens qui ecoutent il reste seulement quelque six deputes dans l assemblee pour presenter une proposition
french je propose que la commission cherche instituer cette fin un fonds europeen dans le domaine social avec l aide des organisations benevoles
french je propose que la commission se tourne vers le conseil et les etats membres pour chercher obtenir d eux qu ils apportent leur contribution financi re un tel fonds
french il doit s agir d un fonds cree sous forme d institution independante dont la direction est composee de personnes provenant des organisations sociales elles m mes ainsi que d observateurs et d experts dans le domaine social
french on pourrait penser qu une telle organisation echapperait en partie aux probl mes bureaucratiques
french le contr le budgetaire serait exerce par des reviseurs professionnels
french je pense que si l on se lance dans une telle t che en faisant preuve d une certaine subtilite diplomatique les etats membres devraient reagir positivement la proposition
french je pense egalement que toutes les autres parties les defavorises sociaux les organisations benevoles les etats membres et les institutions de l ue devraient tirer de grandes satisfactions d une telle institution
french vous nous avez dit la commission est l pour faire face aux frais de fonctionnement des ong or nous parlementaires ce que nous voulons c est faire en sorte que toutes les ong puissent tre servies et financees sur la base d un certain nombre de projets concrets
french car aujourd hui ce sont les grandes ong qui ont la faculte de repondre un certain nombre d appels d offres medecins du monde medecins sans fronti res croix rouge etc et j en oublie mais c est la premi re observation que je voudrais faire
french vous n tes pas sans savoir les difficultes qu ont nombre de petites ong pouvoir souscrire un certain nombre d appels d offres
french or celles ci font un travail de relations de competences tout aussi important que des grandes ong parce que certaines d entre elles n ont pas precisement les logiques administratives qu ont certaines grandes ong
french deuxi mement ce que nous souhaiterions aussi c est pouvoir donner satisfaction aux ong afin d intervenir en amont du drame
french je prends un seul exemple la protection de l enfance
french pendant quatre ans nous avons ete un certain nombre de parlementaires nous battre pour qu un financement soutienne des associations qui x uvraient contre la maltraitance
french on ne nous a pas entendus
french il a fallu l affaire dutroux pour que nous obtenions une ligne budgetaire qui a donne lieu deux programmes daphne et stop
french aujourd hui il n en reste plus qu un seul le programme daphne mais nous pouvons le regretter
french je peux vous dire qu en tant que specialistes des questions de la petite enfance un certain nombre d ong aimeraient bien pouvoir repondre un certain nombre d appels d offres
french enfin il me semble qu il serait souhaitable que les procedures soient simplifiees et qu cet egard je ne sais pas s il faut que cela soit un fonds mais que la commission au moins dans un premier temps puisse mettre la disposition des ong un service leur permettant de se renseigner sur le travail realise par d autres eventuellement de se mettre en reseau thematique pour postuler ulterieurement aux appels propositions de la commission
french voil monsieur le commissaire chers coll gues ce que je voulais dire
french nous avancerons dans le secteur social car nous savons que nous avons progresser au niveau d une cooperation dans le secteur social
french il nous faudra du temps
french c est pourquoi du fait que les questions sociales font essentiellement partie des t ches des ong nous devons avancer sur la question du dialogue civil
french monsieur le president mme lambert et mme ghilardotti ont raison
french les ong europeennes caract re social jouent un r le essentiel dans notre travail comme peut le constater chaque personne ayant etudie les mesures anti discrimination de l article
french depuis la crise budgetaire de qui a engendre le gel des fonds destines au travail que m nent les ong avec certaines des populations les plus vulnerables d europe et des pays en voie de developpement de grand progr s ont ete accomplis
french la presidence portugaise a jete de nouvelles bases en invitant la plate forme d aide europeenne au sommet informel de lisbonne sur les affaires sociales et la presidence fran aise suit l exemple
french des initiatives de ce type ont ete reconnues dans les conclusions du sommet de lisbonne
french mais les mots ne suffisent pas et deux ans apr s la crise budgetaire de les difficultes persistent
french cela fait maintenant deux ans que les discussions avec les ong ont ete entamees tout ce que la commission a pu mettre en place suite ces discussions sont un document de reflexion et deux groupes de travail internes qui se sont tr s peu rencontres
french entre temps les ong et j ai travaille dans le secteur des ong s enlisent dans les r glements bureaucratiques qui ont ete introduits pour augmenter le degre de responsabilite et de transparence mais qui en fait n engendrent qu un surplus de paperasserie
french monsieur le president les probl mes des ong sont aggravees cette assemblee qui cree des r gles difficiles relatives aux exigences de cofinancement definies dans des delais tr s courts
french l unique ligne budgetaire dont nous disposions la ligne b a ete supprimee et la commission n a pu proposer aucune base legale pour le dialogue civil en suggerant soit un r glement du conseil soit un article du traite
french pire encore la commission a fait savoir que les ong caract re social devront tre fondees sur les bases de nos nouvelles lignes budgetaires sur la discrimination et l exclusion sociale
french comment cela est il possible alors que les fonds octroyes ces programmes ont ete reduits bien au del des limites du raisonnable
french de nombreuses ong caract re social utiles doivent faire face de serieuses crises dues l inaction de la commission et du conseil
french il m est arrive de voir une ong remplir une candidature pour des projets necessitant pages de budget et tellement de documents annexes que le dossier pesait plus de douze kilos
french monsieur le president cela doit changer
french les ong sont essentielles pour notre travail et nous nous devons de les soutenir
french je voudrais remercier tous les deputes ayant participe ce debat pour leurs idees m me les plus critiques
french je les transmettrai et les introduirai dans les debats de la commission
french je me permets juste de donner deux br ves reponses
french tout d abord en ce qui concerne les bases juridiques et le financement
french nous ne devons pas oublier qu il fait partie des caracteristiques d une organisation non gouvernementale qu elle ne soit pas dependante du financement par des instances publiques
french sinon elle ne s appellerait pas organisation non gouvernementale mais bien organisation gouvernementale
french j ai donc du mal comprendre l appel frequemment repete visant ce que les organisations non gouvernementales voient leur financement enti rement assure par des gouvernements ou par la commission
french il ne peut en effet s agir que d un soutien et d une collaboration des projets
french cela pour le fond du probl me
french le th me des organisations non gouvernementales et de l elargissement a donc ete maintes fois aborde
french je veux repondre cela parce que cela touche ma competence directe
french toutes les idees que j ai entendues dans le cadre de ce debat sont concretisees depuis longtemps
french nous collaborons intensivement via les aides de preadhesion avec les organisations non gouvernementales dans les pays candidats l adhesion et la strategie de communication dont le cadre organisationnel et financier a ete arr te dans l intervalle s adresse aussi tout particuli rement aux organisations non gouvernementales dans les pays candidats l adhesion car il s agit precisement d impliquer pleinement la societe civile dans cet important processus politique
french je rapporterai fid lement tout le reste la commission je ne tairai pas l attitude que j ai ressentie plut t critique au cours de ce debat et je vous promets que je m engagerai en tous les cas pleinement la simplification des procedures et l acceleration des decisions
french mesdames et messieurs merci beaucoup
